federalism What basis commentSome developments taken place 14th Finance Commissions FC recommendations Cesses surcharge increased significantly even GST The States felt shortchanged way Centrally Sponsored Schemes CSS restructured increasing share State government put way GST administered The general debate earlier Bihar model competing Gujarat model different States models development competing otherNow suddenly one nation one policy sentiment overtaking models And Planning Commission forum States also nowDue institutional vacuum Ministries directly dealing CSS So spirit discussion dialogue replaced diktats various Ministries Some say dialogue untypical cooperative federalismYouve said States forced share resources CSS After 14th FC recommendations impression Centre devolving States went 32 42As coauthor GR Reddy explain comparison 32 42 39 became 42 way computations differed This increase offset actions cesses surcharges CSS So virtually advantage StatesGR Reddy The 14th FC considered entire revenue account Unlike previous FCs considered even Plan revenue account As result Plan transfers subsumed tax devolutionThe difference 14th FC others former away sector specific grants amount 45 total devolution If take two together actual devolution would 39 earlier became 42 Even 3 increase visible neutralised Centre The reality increased matching contribution States CSS done away 6000 model schools started 2011 half way 201516 took decision terminate entire scheme model schoolsThe entire burden running schools meeting expenditure capital operational expenditure fallen StatesThey restructured 66 CSS 22 umbrella schemes So change number CSS schemes All components remained sameWhy didnt States raise issueWe done 15Th FC communicated Centre done correctImmediately 14th FC recommendations accepted Hon Prime Minister wrote us saying States flush funds We wrote back saying absolutely increase flow funds States change composition transfers favour untied transfers Now happened qualitative change transfers States getting money untied transfersThe total transfers percentage gross revenues States Centre remained level 49Arent untied transfers desirable It frees States use funds whatever purpose deem fitWhatever additional money come untied transfers tied towards meeting additional commitmentIn revised pattern CSS put moneyYou made commitment cant uncommit But changed pattern Whatever untied funds got put schemesFor example 2014 Telanganas contribution CSS around 2000 crore In 201516 change funding patterns gone 3500 crore So additional commitment part StatesThere commitment States termination CSS model schools scheme example Another BRGF backward regions grant fund Telangana State 9 10 districts BRGF They substantially reduced allocations women child welfare alsoThere view many CSS money efficiently usedThe concern CSS money thinly spread across schemes For example take education health States spending close 80 The Centre supplementing States 20 make much difference That comes conditionalities submission uses visits Central teams delays release funds As result procedures unable fully utilise Centres allocations I dont think State used funds Centre entirelySo solution offer funds allow States free handThe Commission Dr Reddy recommended number CSS restricted nationally identified prioritiesDr YV Reddy Basic issue Finance Commission one mechanism essentially meant sharing taxes based formula 8090 transfers States always tax devolution In tax devolution conditions much weight give population census population consideration namely fiscal capacity The question weight give If give weight equally efficiency equity cancel senseYou mentioned institutional vacuum Do think NITI Aayog able step plateThere deficiencies way Planning Commission functioned There impression given States go Commission supplicant discussion That weakness corrected In correction process bad habit got rid new system There forum Each Ministry become authority unto able dictate terms StatesIs deliberate Aayog power evolve thusThat question mark Whether design default result individual Ministries indicating States means coherent comprehensive view States processThere view terms reference 15th FC may stand test constitutional validity Whats viewThere 34 issues It true generated unprecedented reaction Never FC number CMs got together protested Also scholars questioned constitutional validity Terms Reference example whether need revenue deficitThe constitution provides FC needs decide Third 15th FC asked review 14th FC It continuing process Above Commission asked make recommendations keeping view performance indicators States conform certain policy parameters reflected existing policy CentreThe way FC structured supposed instrument central governments priorities day So questioned several groundsMost considerations mentioned ToR necessarily binding FC The Commission choose choose take account But needs courage vision Commission hoping thereWhats view controversy base date population census 15th FCThe whole question whether correct thing It difficult defend outdated population basis Because FC supposed take account needs State period How 1971 population determine needs State 2021 It undertaken grounds States penalised But States taken action family planning 1971 They dont get anything It continuing incentive rightThis time prescribed 2011 population That also valid The FC recommendations 2020 So estimated population States period 20202025 Ideally stipulation date population left FC one population relevant periodIsnt GST good example cooperative fiscal federalismIt extraordinary institution commendable It come existence overnight It started informal committee Finance Ministry evolved In implementation dissatisfaction expressed The fact Centre veto increases influence But part game Concerns may way working But institutional set extraordinarily good It good example collaboration cooperation institution Union StatesCan replicated areasExactly This revenue side On expenditure side fiscal transfers outside FC brought interState council That recommendation 14th FCThe GST Council may replicated good approach build On expenditure side different type collaboration compared revenue sideIs recommendation 15th FC giveYes The transfers States Centre take FC nonFC routes The 14th FC gave recommendations structure nonFC transfers Its ambit adviceThere three approaches virtually abolish Commission making constitutional amendment say percentage second continuous FC GST Council type mechanism FC gets subsumed third FC design new institutional arrangements technical political consensusbased recommended 14th FCAll provoked partly GST Council positive partly institutional vacuum pushing us find new institutional mechanismsPleasantly surprised functioning GST Council It comprises people varying vote bank compulsionsThe consensus result number years effort Consultative process going last 1015 years States also convinced winwin situation sake tax harmonisation across country felt better And also feeling GST better form tax leading better compliance It builds value chain Initially apprehension part manufacturing States may lose destination tax So put place 2 year statutory mechanism compensated period 5 years The states yielded lot space Centre For

accelerated downwards last 5 yearshttpsimgurcomSoCXbPiThe author seems correlate difference inflation exchange rate two actually linked directly For instance Indias inflation rates years 2009 2010 steep 1497 947 respectively During years Japans inflation rates 167 040 respectively The Yen actually increased value Rupee dropped value within respective domestic markets Yet exchange rate January 2009 till January 2011 2 full yearshttpsimgurcomDHgubGX remained relatively steady somewhere 0485 0550 average range 0065 One would expect see massive increase exchange rate one yen able buy

JapanHas author even considered scenarios winwin That economics zerosum game This deal great Japan It also good India So since author lazy schmuck heres actual mathWe currently getting Japan invest USD 17 Billion projectSince author concerned exchange rates thats JP 189 trillion Which currently 109 trillion Note While writing I used figures like JP 1892 tr 1093 tr calculations rounded last digit editing text order avoid visual confusion 4digit years like 1967 2067 etc So calculation precise looksOver 50 years 01 interest rates amount payable end 2067 would JP 199 trillion If current exchange rate remain constant would 115 trillion But assuming peak exchangerate last 10 years ie 071872 July 2012 India would repaying 143 trillion Thats STILL interest rate less 054 assuming loaned us entire amount Rupees instead YenSo effectively worst case scenario got loan trillion rupees 50 years 05 interest rateNow heres authors argument lack math turned headAssuming 0 inflation Japan value currency repaid Yen equally valuable 50 years would paid JP 199 trillion upfront So arent losing anything time Thats great themBut seeing Indias inflation assumed significantly 0 value 143 trillion repayment amount 2067 actually lower perceived within India Remember domestic inflation doesnt translate directly exchange rates So even YenRupee exchange rate becomes horribly high domestic inflation would

547,6z7u08,Understanding Petro Dollar possible decline Fiat Currencies affects India Why maybe time look elsewhere hold foreign reserves,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6z7u08/understanding_the_petro_dollar_its_possible/,52,45,concernadian,The whole thing came recently discussions I people use dollar international trade would happen major economies world stopped using Dollar What Impact BRICS Why US many wars middle east supposedly oil never really take oil How US rich 800 military bases around world defence budget larger rest world combined About countries still hold US dollar reserves US trillions dollars debt much debt US economy still afloat So I thought putting together anyone else may want learn Now I gleaned reading matter I economist anyone wants correct anything I would welcome accept criticism reference material substantiating point 1944 countries entered Bretton Woods Agreement basically said worlds currrecies would backed US Dollar US dollar would backed gold country could convert currency US dollars redeem US gold exchange rate 35 dollars per ounce gold Since US largest gold reserves time 75 entire worlds gold everyone agreed This also allowed US treasury fix exchange rates dollar different currencies set interest rates interbanking transactions etc However multiple wars US 60s caused domestic inflation US value Dollar fall This caused panic countries started redeeming gold US treasury The US gold fell 20000 tonnes 8100 tonnes quickly Thus 1971 Nixon closed gold window ie suspended ability nation redeem US gold dollars took gold backing US Dollar While allowed US retain gold reserves made need US dollar among countries non existent So everyone started move away Dollar After US economy started spiral price gold became 135 dollars per ounce On top Arab world hiked oil prices Now US desperately needed stabilize spiral So brokered deal Saudis oil producers would trade oil nothing US Dollars convince OPEC middle eastern north African oil producing countries also invest OPECs oil profits US treasury buying US Treasury bonds This basically means OPEC buying US debt Not US printing Dollars amount Foreign investments US treasury made Oil producing nations oil profits So basically profits every barrel sold OPEC make way US treasury become value dollars printed Ultimately profits oil stronger dollar lesser profits oil weaker dollar Thus US gets double benefit every barrel oil way In exchange US would sell Saudis advance weapons gold demanded So basically weapons gold sale exchange trading oil dollars props US dollar Gold still propping US dollar indirectly forcing oil producers trade dollars Thus petrodollar born This caused world need US dollar If wanted buy oil needed US dollar either converting currency selling stuff US The latter preferred cheaper exchanging currency also grows economy So US became benchmark international trade since country hope grow economy without using energy aka oil cant oil without US dollars As long countries need oil US print Dollars thin air balance oil barrels explained without actually even owning single drop oil Other countries need gold balance currency US need control oil need control currency traded keep economy afloat later US foreign policy Similarly US bokered deal Latin American countries trade US Dollar also give precedence US EU Japanese products trade So countries decide shun dollar trade currencies would eventually cause OPEC switch well Dollar could collapseHow Well US basically printing enormous amounts money thin air This money used domestically much larger extent globally If international oil trade dollar stops people stop needing dollar use currency So internationally circulating dollars would come back US Now many dollars little amount treasury would cause hyperinflation economic spiral However logical next step would destroy excess dollars coming abroad would keep countrys economy afloat While okay remember dollar printed The foreign investments treasury profits oil trade dollars That would go away well essentially leaving nothing treasury dollar valued Hence dollar literally worth money printed onSecond since US currency basically petrodollar power depends control oil So right whoever controls middle east major power Today Saudi Arabia controls Middle East US controls Saudi Arabia USSaudi brotherhood sort makes impossible countries influence Russia tried decades establish strong foothold middle east unsuccessful It also dictated US foreign policy far last 5 decades Like I said US needs control oil reserves currency oil traded Hence wars hear oil actually oil per se intimidation tactics countries announced would longer accept dollar currency international oil trade Egs When Ayatollah Iran announced intention denounce dollars oil trade use currency instead US backed Iraq go war Iran even provided Weapons mass destruction use Iran later used excuse invade Iraq prosecuted Saddam Hussein When Iraq invaded Kuwait major producer oil able pay loans Kuwait later asked Euro used oil trade rather Petrodollar US invaded Iraq When Gaddafi asked gold based Dinar instead US dollars oil trade US invaded Libya When Chavez Us staged coup Venezuela However starting nonpetro currency would break link oil Middle east would become less relevant Economic power interest energy concerns It still important less economic geopolitical chessboard US today It may actually solution achieving peace middle eastHowever another thing happens Middle East controls prices oil tied Dollar Recently Middle East OPEC basically Saudi Arabia decided drop international prices economic reasons Now countries oil production major source revenue trade dollars eg many N African countries Venezuela seen economy completely stabilise destroyed These countries sick US Saudi controlling markets way affects countries adversely Hence countries switching international trading system gold based currency cause economies stabiliseThe international reserves EU etc hand seen increased holdings OPEC countries worried increasing power countries international banking system They would glad get rid holdingsNow non Dollar currency would cause fall US dollar value In lieu another thing needs considered A lot developing countries international trade deficits Now trade deficits currency country debt owed internationally accepted currency eg Dollar If debt dollars conversions interest rates borrowing determined according rules US treasury Again rates US treasury linked value dollar Most countries giving loans prefer dollars historically Dollar strong trusted collapse hence money owe safe The countries taking loans also convert debts dollars easier country debt owed change value debt owed manipulating currency dollar determined conversion currencies fixed rates safe everyone However slight problem If owe debt 1 dollar someone pay debt depend value dollar currency particular instant So dollar gotten stronger wrt currency shall pay money dollar gotten weaker owe less money currency Hence fall dollar would beneficial countries owe debt dollars bad countries loaned debt dollarsAlso taking debt dollars becomes cheaper value dollar falls since US treasury interest rates directly tied dollars hence becomes cheaper borrow dollars Also I said grows weaker still yo owe less moneyOne thing consider regarding fall Dollar Uptil oil producers buying US treasury bonds due Bretton Woods deal Other countries US corporations Now US treasury gives fixed rate interest investing treasury This rate turn linked value dollar Stronger dollar interest US Treasury bonds foreign countries invest Now means foreign countries would much rather invest money US Treasury assured fixed rate interest invest 3rd world countries take risk maybe losing However value dollar fall countries would much rather draw US treasury invest startups different countries domestically etcThe side coin would countries dependent US investment Should value dollar fall investment received US would lesser valueOn hand one thinh Like I said investments dollars governed US treasury rules Now basically US banks cut taxes money transfer conversion artificially keeping low fuel domestic world trade etc If dollar collapse people wouldnt trade dollars They would trade currencies The inetrbanking across world would governed rules currency trade eg BRICS nations follow tariffs etc Shanghai Bank reserves held So effect would depend rules bank deal detrimental beneficial depending banks policies compared dollarAlso countries holdings US treasury would lose entire value foreign reserves On hand coountries like BRICS reserves international banks would retain value foreign reserves banksWhat meanIndian Currency would also fall fall dollar current state Now usually run around perception Indian currency backed gold Thats true The truth 99 todays currencies US Dollar Euro Indian rupee fiat currencies ie value determined gold hold economic strength government Only average 47 countrys currency today backed gold US Dollar 45 Indian rupee 5 The rest held terms foreign reserves countries like form US Dollar around 70 US treasury bonds world bank IMF currencies around 25 BRICS foreign reserves etc Currently rs 1000 rs 50 gold around 670 held form US dollars Rs 280 currencies You might ask Well remember Bretton Woods agreement At time US 75 worlds gold backed dollar dollar backed currencies currency country backed directly indirectly dollar gold Now difficult keep gold country convenient countries hold foreign reserves dollars especially fixed exchange rates provided Hence portion currency held dollars However Nixon shock 1971 dollar removed gold backing So automatically currencies backed dollar 99 world currencies also became fiat currencies result However dollar still good trusted one thought much especially since dollars printed thin air However prospect trust dollar fading started worry experts Because senseless printing dollars exchange fiat currencies total amount currency nowhere near compensated gold reserves even gold world put together It would form 10 currency world Now putting disturbing detail aside Dollar collapse 670 rupees 1000 would become worthless So isnt wise hold US dollars No many countries woken factChina secretly amassing large amounts gold OPEC countries started removing capital US treasury See oil producers receiving US gold exchange trading oil US dollars accumulated holdings countries treasuries Now crazy gold received bought material assets like real estate etc even countries Now simply sell US treasury bonds buy assets gold real estate recent years Now start depleting treasury cause fall value dollar turn causing countries withdraw invest elsewhere That coupled Russia China trade Roubles Yuan India Iraq trading oil outside dollar Germany China trading outside Dollar strenghtening BRICS bank etc Dollar showing steady decline So India also wisen start replenishing treasury gold sell holdings dollars euros invest currencies rise This one reason BRICS could important India countries BRICS whether like Another thing using another currency would would take away power US slap economic sanctions whichever country choose This one major reasons Putin teamed China order bypass US sanctionsEdit The thing worries nations international trade foreign reserves dollars gives US single handed say economies Just like Nixons unilateral decision changed fate currencies decisions also change economies US dictate rules dont follow sanctions So countries want take back power making decisions handsNext petrodollar based commodity depleted Oil reserves declining world moving towards sources gree energy nuclear energy etc So petrodollar decline destined However would US next They could shift backing currency nuclear reserves new crazy idea someones hat That inevitably affect countries want say itOn hand Chinas attempt start gold backed currency may pan like I said gold world sufficient back currencies world Also since currencies still large amount dollar backing fall dollar would make percent currency valueless therefore even reserve another foreign currency could still cause fall Indian currency though might little mitigated On hand fiat currencies run investors trust currency So even dollar falls fiat currency foreign reserves dollar may fall confidence currency still high Sadly currency would Chinese Yuan So policy fix I still trying work solution This post evolution My thoughts still evolution I would really like economists come hold serious well informed sane discussion I add points occur

nothing new Throwaway account since Id like stay anonymous wanted let thoughts openA bit first I loved computers pretty young age time I simply loved hobby I also remember young reading tons books topics like space nature The thing I good middle school Physics Computer Science kinda ignored subjects I also loved helping students subjects extent teachers would point stop noisy get back seat kind synonyms I pretty open future wondering held Anyway I decided pick EngineeringEverything going downward spiral since As typical kid India trying get good Engineering college I went called JEE coaching classes These places horrible Over time I realised coaching classes simply forcing material onto students If actual learning happening given vast syllabus wouldnt surprising whenever high school kid India marked innovation science Rather see students killing able score good marks examination There intense pressure kids since youre constantly told making good college equates woman marrying youre going working awful job jobless In short life going become fucked see kids already making peace death instead And fucking assholes feel helping reducing population country weeding unworthy Just stop making kids rate shit fuckheads Instead making positive effect country coaching centres asking shitload money simply saturating already saturated field Engineering India Some parents also force kids coaching centres faculty flaunting achievements Gods gift world Anyway coaching centres symptom core problem reputed colleges India accept students solely basis one two examinations colleges like seduced AICTE approved college This whole education thing turned fucking businessI failed JEE since I couldnt keep The failure doesnt hurt partially way rejecting system Ive come realisation I learn things solely books paper I need experience reality I digest anything Which I probably good loved Physics Computer Science It costs virtually nothing see things motion see equations really match write computer programs stuff everything makes sense The thing everything way consumes lot time I feel worth Its extremely hard work high school concepts look real world significance time examinations pretty much formulae rote basedAnyway I joined tier3 college hoping least make nice Computer Science since need Computer experience anything But oh lord fuck place Just know I spent high school years learning program writing small scripts manipulate environment eventually I started working people make opensource software So helped get GSoC first year college worked genuine people working hard make positive impact world If GSoC Id also forced attend summer training learn HTML CSS along students college students kept idle like half session know restrictions put even idle phones YouTube heads taking break talking students seriously I another friend mine GSoC 2nd year know students supposed attend training institute paying institute money summer break apparently GSoC wasnt considered since seen online course opposed going attending training institute Head Department So rejected Poor guy still pay private institute forged training certificate despite working hard lie worked training GSoC projectIll talk wonders Our college called Soft Skills sessions instead learning communicate properly people simply taught flaunt bluff every little thing everyone speak hollow words impress people since end college cares headline highest number placements offered Limca Book Records Rather receiving proper technical knowledge spend time practising aptitude questions Many students difficulty communicating structuring grammar forming sentences simple English due unfortunate backgrounds yet work ever done help students become proficient Its 3 semesters since weve studying Software Engineering Software Testing learn craft creating maintain software literally single fucking line code yet Most students still believe testing software looking bugs hand There hasnt even mention automated tests sort till date I 3 years And authorities find students good solving aptitude questions going differentiate making solve CodeChef problems extra classes remaining students merely possession college timeWe assigned work team project every semester evaluated professors experience said technology project based These professors end judging students asking standardised definitions desired technology final viva instead actually evaluating asking project specific questions No wonder majority students steal GitHub copypaste projects peers one cares Also assignment questions blunt hardly thinking involved look boom get full marks submitted time Now I could keep listing whatever hell wrong Minimum attendance 75 exams Students forced stay seated heads even concerned subject teacher leave substitute teacher nothing teach InternetWiFi censored company called FortiGuard anyway Internet hardly works Cant eat roam leave campus 12 noon Worst students brainwashed blindly trust authorities believe faculty truly full professionals ones help get job keep repeating words We arent really learning anything actual useI dont even know whether situation colleges India I happen oneNow helps really nice opensource projects writes technical posts trying best repeat Internet already knows fighting censorship trying help peers random internet people anything technical whenever
