0,g76o5f,The real loser in India's errupting Islamaphobia: Caste politics.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g76o5f/the_real_loser_in_indias_errupting_islamaphobia/,88,53,HairLikeWinterFire,"TLDR: My (unqualified) opinion is that dalit political movement has seen the most erosion in the anti-muslim appraoch the government has championed.

Note: This post is for discussion. If you have nothing but belligerent responses that add nothing to the conversation I will report you. If you only have worn out, down over a thousand times arguments of being caste blind, having merit and anti reservation nonsense, I will be ignoring you. 

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, lets talk.

The anti muslim sentiment grows stronger even in lockdown, with the hindu right finding more ways to demonize muslims everyday. I didnt think it could be possible, but every day it seems they have a new angle of attack. 

And such it has been since day 1 i.e. the day the 2014 elections results came out when the muslim techie was murdered by a hindu mob and that mosque attack happened, I'm forgetting where. The very day of the results. Modi hadnt even taken up PMship that day. 

So to begin, Anti-Muslim rhetoric creates a unified Hindu identity. This is something that BJP has long worked for and was one of the goals of VHP, HM and RSS since their inception - create a Hindu identity that trumps caste indentity so that the caste status quo is maintained while killing any caste discourse. 

Now, I'm muslim. And I have no intention of blaming Dalits for the victory of BJP. Dalits, much like Muslims, have been promised much by politicians purporting to be their champions but delivery has been less than spectacular. Lalu's first term & Maywati's first full term withstanding, no government has been able to delivery upon their promises to their dalit and obc voter very much. So yes, I do not blame these communities for voting outside their 'champions', for 'fracturing' the community vote. 

But the fact remains that Modi's government has done spectacular work for the backward communities (barring muslims). We in urban areas scoff at the Modi governments but their work for the financially weak and socially disadvantaged has been phenomenal. From being called ""Congress + Cow"" it has been jokingly called ""Prakash Karat + Cow"". Such is the success of Modi's socialist policies that I have to begrudgingly accept it as the unequivocal truth.

But coming to the matter at hand, OBC representation in Parliament has been dropping and sarvana i.e. upper caste repesentation is increasing. Now, Dalits have reserved seats so while their count can not decrease, but this seat reservation is working against them. I'm going to copy paste directly from an article here to explain this

[Not a single constituency in India has more than 50 per cent Dalit population, which means it’s always the non-Dalits who decide the fate of Dalit candidates in reserved constituencies. A vocal or assertive Dalit leader has the least chance of winning from such seats. To be re-elected, a Dalit MP must be careful not to antagonise the non-Dalits, and one way of ensuring this is by remaining silent in Parliament.](https://theprint.in/opinion/17th-lok-sabha-looks-set-to-confirm-ambedkars-fears-no-vocal-dalits-in-parliament/232383/)

Note that Balasaheb knew this would happen. Which is why he proposed that non dalits not be given a vote on reserved seats. I am very much with him on this.

So who is the loser here? Mayawati has lost her base. There can be no doubt about it. The BSP+SP combine failed because SP votes were transfered to BSP but the BSP vote was not. Why? Because Dalits find BJP a more attractive proposition than BSP.  Who else? Lalu and Mulayam have lost a significant base altho this could be attributed to multiple reasons. It is also less significant because OBC leaders are many. Dalit leaders are few. 

While Chandrashekar 'Raavan' Azad has made a great big splash, he is being kept under hold by the government almost since day 1. He has the appeal to be a mass leader and present a large potential threat to the status quo. But he has been muzzled and jailed as often as was possible. 

Ultimately even the news cycles focus on muslim, and the caste conflicts happeneing everyday take a backseat, all the while forgetting that 85% of Indian Muslims are lower caste muslims. Here too, the muslim identity has trumped the caste identity and they are doubly the losers here considering that most muslim victim to Islamaphobic attack tend to be the under privileged and of backward caste.

This is all by design, mind you. The idea here is the same I mentioned earlier. Maintain caste status quo and the cost of caste identity. And its working.

Note that Modi himself never speaks about caste. Despite being an OBC he never mentions caste struggles and his own caste related experiences. So his being OBC does not bring more visibility to the problems of the oppressed castes.

But this rant is not just about this situation, it is about people's ignorance and lack of knowledge, people don't understand what is propoganda, and they don't know there history either and they continue to pit up a communuty against a political party. No BJP does not represent Hindus all it represents are the hindu extremists, so when i say fuck bjp, it means, fuck the politicians who are making this country burn. Bjp is the only party who has reached new heights and depths of instigating people to turn on each other, and paint muslims as someone who are gonna attack hindus for no reason. Regardless of what people want, a political party's job is to maintain communal harmony in a democratic country. What part of this people don't undertstand ? and why are dalits even supporting BJP's assholes, they beat up dalits, discriminate against them, all bjp is trying to do is keep brahmin supremacy in this country. Everyone is crazy about religion, i say fuck religion, if you believe in a higher power that is cool i don't care but killing in the name of god, fuck no.

Now as the analysis were going on, experts on TV pointed out some really interesting traits of Kejriwal's Election campaign, which were basically some core reasons behind this victory:

>Not getting into communal vs secular scenario

>Made arguments on work profile.

>Assumed a soft hindutva position. Rejected an Idea that is Hindutva but not a belief that is Hinduism.

>Redefined 'Nationalism'. Rejected Bhajapa's version of the same thing.

58,e1yy9u,"Did Sharad Pawar, NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena just defeat BJP in the Greatest Game of Political Chess to have been played in India?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e1yy9u/did_sharad_pawar_ncp_congress_and_shiv_sena_just/,830,125,jasonj2232,"After weeks of political maneuvering, backstabbing and drama that if it were made into a television series would rival Game of Thrones and House of Cards (and we're not talking about S8 GoT and S6 HoC), it looks like we're finally getting some clarity about what is happening, what has happened and what will happen in Maharashtra.

If you haven't been following, here is what happened:

* The people of Maharashtra voted in the State Elections on 21/10/2019.
* The primary alliances competing in the elections were the NDA (made up of BJP and Shiv Sena) and the UPA (made up of NCP and Congress).
* BJP lost 17 seats and Shiv Sena lost 7 while Congress gained 2 seats and the NCP gained 13.
* BJP got the largest share of votes but no individual party got enough seats to form a majority government (required number of seats to form a government in the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha is 145).
* After the results were declared, the Shiv Sena refused to form a government with the BJP because their demands for equal share in power and the post of CM for 2.5 years was not met.
* The governor (a member of the BJP and RSS btw), from the 8th to the 11th of November, invited the BJP, then the Shiv Sena and then the NCP to form the government and prove majority.
* After all parties either refused to or failed to prove majority, President's Rule was imposed on 12th November.
* Meanwhile, the Congress, NCP and the Shiv Sena (which has historically opposed and has been opposed by the Congress and NCP and has a vastly different ideology compared to the NCP and the Congress)  entered into an alliance together to form the government.
* Before they could form the government though, Ajit Pawar, nephew of Sharad Pawar and his chosen representative, 'broke away' from the NCP along with a few 'rebel' MLAs and joined hands with the BJP to form the government.
* On 23 November, at 5:36 AM, the governor revoked President's rule and accepted the formation of the BJP-Ajit PAwar government, administering the oath of office to Devendra Fadnavis, who became the CM and entered his second term , and Ajit Pawar, who became Deputy CM. Suspiciously, around this same time, all corruption charges and investigations against Ajit Pawar were dropped.
* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena challenged the formation of this government in the Supreme Court and demanded a floor test. Sharad Pawar publicly disavowed Ajit Pawar and his actions.
* The Supreme Court directed the new government to prove its majority by evening today.
* Today, unable to prove majority, Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar resigned and the new government was dissolved.

What is happening (as of 19:42 IST) and will happen:

* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena will form government with Uddhav Thackeray as the CM.
* MLAs from all three parties are in the Trident Hotel rn to elect Uddhav as their CM.
* Ajit Pawar and the 'rebel' MLAs from the NCP are back in the NCP. ~~Ajit Pawar will be Deputy CM~~ (edit: it's still left to be seen what Ajit Pawar's fate is but the process of reconciliation seems to have already started).
* The terms of the power sharing, AFAIK, are still unknown but will most probably be that Shiv Sena and NCP will hold the CM post for 2.5 years each with the Congress will play a supporting role, with all three parties sharing equal power.

(Edit: What follows is speculation from my side but imo it is very probable that this might have happened)

 Now all this might seem like a crazy series of events, but I can't help but feel that all events, after the Shiv Sena entered into an alliance with the NCP and Congress, have been carefully orchestrated by all three parties and especially Sharad Pawar, who I believe has shown Amit Shah that Shah is still a diaper-wearing amateur at a game that Pawar is a veteran of. 

Sharad Pawar and Co have managed to:

* **Split the Sena-BJP alliance:** Although the alliance was always rocky, Pawar and Co have managed to split a natural alliance of the BJP and Shiv Sena that was borne out of a shared Hindutva idealogy, while simultaneously managing to form an alliance with their bitter rivals.
* **Prevent BJP from forming the government:** Now this seems super obvious, but its very impressive considering the fact that BJP netted the most amount of votes in the election.
* **Exposed the hypocrisy of the BJP:** BJP has always run on a platform that stated that their party and government were not corrupt, unlike the opposition who has had multiple huge corruption scandals. It was one of the major reasons why they won in 2014. Now, after the saga with Ajit Pawar (who, lets face it, was never seriously splitting with the NCP, and all this was just a ploy), Sharad Pawar has managed to expose the corrupt nature of the BJP in a very public manner.
* **Saved Ajit Pawar from jail:** This is the cherry on top for Pawar and Co and possibly the most stinging thing to happen to the BJP during this whole saga. Pawar has not just managed to expose the corruption of the BJP but also managed to save his nephew from the consequences of corruption using his enemy as the deliverer/tool of salvation.

Now all this is great and dandy for Pawar, NCP, Shiv Sena and the Congress but what does it mean for us observers and the voters of Maharashtra? Well these are the conclusions I ended up on after this whole saga:

* **DEMOCRACY IS DEAD**: I'm sure all the voters who voted for Shiv Sena because they wanted the BJP in power and all the voters who voted for NCP and Congress because they did not want the Shiv Sena in power are feeling duped, betrayed and angry rn, and they have a very good reason to be. If, ultimately, the choice of a population does not even matter, what point is there to Democracy? What point is there to voting? Might as well choose the next government based on who is better at Jenga or Monopoly - Sharad Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray, Devendra Fadnavis or Balasaheb Thorat.
* **INTEGRITY, IDEOLOGY AND PRINCIPLES DON'T MATTER**: All that matters now is power. Yeah the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena have managed to defeat the BJP but at what cost? All parties involved have betrayed the core principles and ideas upon which their parties were found by entering into this alliance. Why even have separate parties then? 
* **VOTERS DON'T MATTER:** All 3 parties have betrayed the trust that their voters and supporters placed in them meanwhile the BJP has betrayed the trust that the general public lays on institutions and figures like the Governor who are supposed to be neutral.

Sharad Pawar and Co might have just managed to win the greatest game of political chess to have been played in India but it is the rest of us common folk who have lost. Regardless of which political ideology you believe in or which party you support, I hope you can agree when I say that this entire saga was a dark period for democracy in India.

Edit: We still can't say for sure if this whole Ajit Pawar saga was a carefully constructed ploy or if he actually betrayed (he is know to make rash decisions) Sharad Pawar. He wasn't present at the joint press conference of the parties where Uddhav Thackeray was announced as the CM and some NCP members asked Sharad Pawar to ensure that Ajit Pawar is back in the fold asap. So it's still unclear but I can definitely say for sure that whether this was by intention or not, it has only helped the NCP-Shiv Sena-Congress alliance.",False,Politics

It was well known he was a hard left individual, with interests in the Russian revolution's Marxist and Socialist policies. He was a patriot and nationalist but never thrived off of it. In my view, it was the best kind of *positive* nationalism wherein you respected and fought for your nation's freedom and dignity but also participated in the active growth of its people from a moral and economical standpoint and did not rely on relentless fanning of the flames to attain unity.

Imagine an India which was built on strong but fair leftist grounds which stressed on equality of sexes, equality of opportunity, **mandatory education**, economic liberation, powerful military and more with equal stress on India being Democratic Republic. 

> Subhash Chandra Bose never interpreted nationalism in its narrow ,perverted and aggressive form. He viewed Indian nationalism from the stand point of  a humanist To3 Bose ,‘Indian nationalism is neither narrow, nor selfish, nor aggressive.It is inspired by the highest ideals of the human race.


There is unequivocally nothing that can really beat this combination of non-exploitative, non-authoritarian socialist country. I know some think-tanks have flirted with the idea of Bose being a ""Hitler"" but one, he was pro-Democracy and two:


> “When I first visited Germany in 1933, I had hopes that the new German nation, which has risen to a new consciousness of its national strength and self-respect, would instinctively feel a deep sympathy for other nations struggling in the same direction.Today,I regret that I have to return to India with the conviction that the new nationalism of Germany is not only narrow and selfish, but also arrogant”

In my opinion, India should have been under a rigorous leadership for a decade or so to set the grounds for **mass education**, equal opportunities, equality of sexes, liberal economic principles and abolition of poverty AND THEN gone on to open up the market internationally and engage in (controlled) Capitalistic ventures where you invest in foreign countries and foreign countries can invest in yours, independent businesses can thrive and so on and which will see a surge in not only economic status but exchange of culture with the people of India **ready for such a venture** as opposed to now where most Indians barely know who they are, what their history is and what their culture is about.",False,Politics

I actually dont mind him. He has done fairly good work in his LS constituency fairly consistently. The issue is with Congress. They were last in power in the state in 1977 under then CM Siddhartha Shankar Ray who hinted down and killed Naxals throughout the state mercilessly and the police regularly arrested and tortured young men and teenage boys even if they were innocent. [My own relative from my mom's side was tortured, he still suffers from PTSD and Nerve disorders today]
After losing to CPM at the start of their 33 year old rule on Bengal, only the young and rising Youth Congress leader Mamata Banerjee kept them relevant in the state until she got fed up with the party central command and left to create TMC in 1997. So for 20+ years Congress is the most irrelevant big 4 party in the state. 
Since 2011 they have tried to create some alliance with CPM and so thats they only way they can come to power, a secondary to a CPM/INC coalition under a CPM CM.


###Surja Kanta Mishra, CPM

A Physician by profession, he might be a good person but as like all other Communist leaders, the Party line decide his politics.  So again, the issue is with the Party, CPM. 

Now i am gonna [quote a FANTASTIC comment made by another user a month ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffqi79/is_mamata_government_in_west_bengal_as/fk06djk/?context=3) fairly regularly in the rest of this post. So credit to him for these parts.

>The communists arrived with the promise of giving farmers and labourers their dues. Strong trade unions were formed to fight for their rights. Industrialists were pressured to increase wages and provide better working conditions.

>But unfortunately, this just made the situation worse. The industrialists had no money to do all that, already their businesses were suffering. As a result - Hartals, Lockdowns, Strikes - most of the industries that had survived were forced to shut shop due to labour unrest and you had hundreds and thousands of people without any jobs! (Quite often these jobless youths were employed by the Communist party as their cadres - leading to the very strong grassroots cadre-based politics of West Bengal, still surviving today).

>By the time the government realised their mistake, it was too late. No industrialist would even come near Bengal given the history of labour unrest. This also coincided with the Manmohan Singh led economic reforms of the Central government, which opened up India to foreign investors. These investors came and set shop in other states - who would want to do business in a communist state?

>When Jyoti Basu retired, the new brigade of CPI(M) decided they had to do something to stop the rot. Again, their efforts backfired. They tried too hard to reassure industrialists to invest in Bengal - leading to Nandigram and Singur unrests (both were cases where the government tried to take land forcibly from the farmers and hand it to industries). Singur agitation ran from late 2005/early 2006, peaking in late 2006 with the Tapasi Mallik rape and murder case (my first taste of student politics happened at this time when about 20 of us did a sit-in to protest and the first time I was detained by police, in my first year of college!), Nandigram agitation reached it's peak with police firing on protesters on 14th March 2007.

>This outraged all Bengalis. In 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Left Front tally in WB went down from 35 to 15. Then in 2011 Assembly elections, Left Front which had won 233 out of 294 seats in 2006, could manage only 62! In a strange irony, the Communist government was defeated resoundingly for the mistake of taking land from peasants and selling it to private industrialists!

So ya, CPM hasnt changed one bit since 2011. The moment they come to power, they will start selling off fertile farm land at basically free prices to industrialists again, ruining farmers again. 
Personally, i hope CPM just dies.

Those people who want this piece of shit to become WB CM because you dont like Mamata, get yourselves checked.   

###Mamata Banerjee, TMC

I will again quote the comment above by u/pro_crasSn8r, but i will add some stuffs of my own too.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Kolkata_firing

>The incident took place on 21 July 1993, when Mamata Banerjee, then state President of Indian Youth Congress, the youth wing of the Indian National Congress in West Bengal, organised a protest march to Writers' Building, the seat of then communist-led Government of West Bengal. They demanded voter photo-ID cards be made mandatory to ensure free and fair polling. However, around 11 AM, one kilometre before the building, they were intervened by the state police, near Metro cinema on Mayo Road and Dorina Road crossing at Esplanade. The police fired at them, resulting in the death of 13 people and several injuries.

She took a bullet to the stomach for protesting for something rightful on the orders of then CM Jyoti Basu.

Her 26 day fast protesting against the CPM on the Singur incident was also very important. 

>So, TMC came to power and Mamata became the CM 9 years ago. Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.

>Has she done everything she could to better Bengal's economy? No, she hasn't. But she has tried. For the first few years it seemed we were going back to 70s and 80s with a lot of promises made but nothing happening on ground. But over the years, her effort has shown. One of the major things she did right was to appoint some good capable professionals and politicians to important ministries like finance, industries, labour, agriculture, urban development and filling the rest with chamchas and career politicians. As a result, economy, civic planning, tourism etc has seen excellent development in the past decade. The biggest thing for me that I have seen is the patient planning, and the setting up of grounds before moving in with a major policy.

>Another thing that gets lost in the minority appeasement rhetoric is the work that has been done for the tribals and indigenous people.

>She has also done excellent work for social welfare, especially for girls. Her ""Kanyashree"" project (scholarship to girls from poor families, as long as they are not forcefully married before they are 18, and as long as they attend schools, along with a one time grant of 25000 rupees when the girl turns 18) has done wonders in Bengal. It has reduced child marriage and increased literacy amongst girls from backward communities in one go. This scheme was even recognised by United Nations as the best social development scheme in the developing world. People don't talk enough about Kanyashree, it is one of the best things to happen in Bengal in my lifetime.

​

>Is Bengal doing great today? No, not at all. There's still loads of problems that need to be addressed.

>Has her rule been clean and corruption free? Absolutely not!Is Bengal free from political violence? Again, no.Has she done enough? Probably not.

​

>But we are heading towards the right direction, albeit slowly. Bengal is not going to be prosperous overnight, there are loads and loads of issues, and she has successfully tackled quite a few of them.

>Overall, I would say she has done more good than harm, which is not something you can say about most governments in India!

NOTE: [Kanyashree Scheme For Girls In Bengal Wins UN Award ](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kanyashree-scheme-for-girls-in-bengal-wins-un-award-1716321)

I actually believe Mamata Banerjee is amongst the best 2 CM's of the state of all time after Dr Bidhan Chandra ray. Every one else did FAR more harm for the state than good.

Also, as seen above, she is THE LEAST EVIL of the 4 choices and she is clearly not a Genocidal Maniac like your beloved Modi. No Genocidal Maniac takes a bullet for whats right.

As such, i am a fan of her even if she has done some questionable and bad things.


###PS: What i left out.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/what-makes-bengal-politics-so-different-from-the-rest-of-india/articleshow/68826757.cms?from=mdr 

Its called Syndicate.

In short: After the Partitions, the local panchayets and whats was left of zamindars along with some local muscles teamed up to form a power structure that dictated everything that happens locally. They decided everything of their local area. This system spread through out the state.

After Bidhan Chandra Ray died, Bangla Congress [then named branch of Bengal INC] basically took the leaders of such groups under their own party banner. Some of them were even given Party tickets and actually, officially became leaders of their said areas.

Just before CPM came in power in 77, majority of these groups switched sides to CPM and became CPM cadres as they were called. [NOTE: CPM actually actively discouraged caste politics and encouraged class politics AND made these groups follow it, which is why caste politics is not prevalent in Bengal despite heavy casteism]

Same said groups switched sides to TMC in 2011 before they won. And then they came to be known as Syndicate.

Its very much clear that whichever party holds these tiny power groups are actually able to become the state rulers.",False,Politics

Times like this makes me value Dr. Manmohan Singh. He would've made an empowered expert committee to guide the country through these tough times, answered questions and through honesty at least would've been reassuring at the wheels. 


Currently though, we have a man who likes the sound of his own voice, lies like there is no tomorrow, hasn't been in a single press conference for the last 6 years while claiming to be the representative of world's largest democracy, makes decisions on a whim based on raw (absent) wisdom, makes people believe in stupid shit(my relatives banged thalis with the zealous fury of a mindless disciple) and makes them do unnecessary and frankly, demeaning things without playing his part in the crisis and is scamming people out of their hard earned money during a time of crisis.

A home minister who is cut off from reality and can hardly be bothered by the deaths and hardships of the masses (as can be expected from a psychopath. If he can murder Muslims, he can watch Hindus die too - A murderer is a murderer). A history graduate in RBI with a wet noodle for a spine. A society that is so frayed that the government doesn't command universal trust like it did earlier.


Dr. Singh, history will indeed judge you kindly. I hope the BJP, which is bereft of all intellect and is like a PR firm with no product, reach out to the opposition parties like Congress, TMC, CPIM, AAP which have quite a bit of expertise by Indian political standards.

He told me all the good things about how he has close Muslim friends. How he COMPULSARILY has to visit 3 of his friend's house for feast during Eid. How when he was looking for partners to play Badminton, most hindu groups didn't take him in but the Muslim guys welcomed him with open arms. How he is welcome into their homes where other men cannot go, (meaning they consider like a family member). So when he told me all this, I expected he will have empathy towards the sufferings of the Muslims since he is close to so many. 

But as you'd have guessed by now, he was a Modi supporter with strong distrust towards Muslims. Although he claimed he is not against them (proof that he has so many close Muslim friends) but he felt they are extremely fanatic (kattar). I kept asking have they ever forced you or anyone to do anything against their wish. If not how can they be fanatic. Whatever their problems it is within their community. He strongly believes Muslims have 'enjoyed' the appeasement politics for many years and got so many benefits. How they want to have 4-5 kids to increase their population. He felt all Muslims should have gone to Pakistan during partition. You know, the usual stuff.

If this is how someone who has close Muslim friends thinks, then what can we say about the majority who have very little connection with Muslims. Every day, every conversation just goes onto solidify my belief that it is impossible to overcome this hate. We will either go the Germany way or the Israel way. Either way the future is not looking good.

I have some ideas to make this debate to the points. These ideas seem impossible but are not. Ofcourse even if we try to make it happen, they won't agree to it, because they cannot stand the truth.  

• Get Modi, Shah and Ajay Bisht in the same room with Ramachandra Guha, Azad, Sadaf Jafar, Kanhaiya, Dhruv Rathee, etc.  

• Exclude TV journalists. Bik gaye hai ye log.  

• Have a team from Altnews or some expert Google users who know how to search for stuff on the internet. To immediately fact check Modi, Shah and Ajay Bisht's statements and if it's false, prove it to them on the spot. If it's true, I'm sure we can find something to counter it.

But, as it started happening on a daily basis, I was denied access to  their customer  care dept.( It was denied because, i was able to connect them through other Vodafone numbers)

 I took resort in Twitter and contacted them . They did reply instantly with a message that their executive will be calling as soon as possible. None of those people called. ( I continued pestering them for two days, still those hyprocrites were in connivance).
Only after emailing and doing MNP message , i got calls from Vodafone to ask why i did the MNP messages.( they wanted to know what made me to port from their network [and after all these calls and tweets] SMH).  They did refund ,but only after 2 emails, 10 tweets, and 3 calls from another number.

So , that was last month. Yesterday , I unknowingly used up my 1 GB data pack along with my remaining balance . As usual, I proceeded to recharge through Paytm. Surprise!!! processing failed!! one, two, three, leave it,  six times, the processing failed. Tried with the Vodafone App, nope!! all the tranaction pages starting showing 'Request page cannot be processed ' messages( data packs can be activated  but no talktime ones)Tried calling their customer care, again surprise!! call doesnt go through.

These are some uninspiring thoughts when we have poured in years of work to learn, unlearn, build, dismantle, and assemble again. 

Some jumping ship, some hanging around fighting for the cause; begging, borrowing, appropriating, somehow, you do everything to never let doubts creep into your mind. 

Some nights are spent, staring at a blank screen, unresponsive code, a sad prototype of the dream that you chase.

Some days are spent, evaluating yourself, if the sum total of your life was a failure that was staring you in the face each day, each night. Your self-worth becomes zero, you become completely undesirable to people who probably loved you once, you have already jerked off to all the porn that you could handle.

By this time, all your friends have become your creditors, with lines of credits exhausted, you scroll your contact list constantly to find that one person, not to seek funds, but to talk with.
We try to hark back for simpler times, reminiscence the moments that made us laugh, then, but we hope probably it would bring an honest smile to our face – our smiles that we had pawned off we did not know when, to users, downloads, sessions and GMVs.

Then one day, you come home, stare at the blank screen, try to make sense of things, break down, and just before letting go of everything seems like an option. You think of Ali, you think of Lincoln, you seek wisdom in the hymns of Nanak, and sagacity and enlightenment from Bhagvad Gita; but you know who comes to your rescue, Earnest Hemingway.

*You are not made for defeat, you can be destroyed, but not defeated.*

To further (mis)quote Hemingway, sometimes our actions are not immediately discernible and when we try for something beyond attainment, something that has never been done, and things that others have tried and failed, and perhaps with ‘karma’ you will succeed.

> I am going to write the truth about this unfair evaluation..there are few things u must know...
> 
> 1. GGSIPU pays Rs. 25 per answer book ....in one bundle there are 30 answer books so it makes Rs750/-  for evaluating one bundle....GGSIPU norms say that a evaluator must take 3 hours to evaluate one bundle....so in a day a evaluator can evaluate a maximum of two bundles.....which makes a total earning of Rs.1500/- per day + a conveance of Rs.600/- per day making the total amount = Rs. 2100/-.
> Now what actually happens is in the university there are two evaluation centres one for first and third year and the other for second and final year.....now actually what happens is....an evaluator reaches centre A at 9:30 am and get a bundle issued which he/she checks in one hour but do not deposit it as the university employees will not take it back before three hours...so they leave that bundle there and rush too the B centre and get another bundle issued there at 11:00  they check it by 12:00 now they rush back to centre A to return their previous bundle and get a new bundle issued there....the same process is repeated and an evaluator ends up in checking two bundles each at both evaluation centres thus earning Rs. 4200/- a day instead of Rs. 2100/-  a day..
> now just imagine the answer book u wrote in 3 hours is evaluated in less then 2 minutes.....coz the evaluator has to right the marks on front sheet and do the total and also fill an additional evaluation sheet with marks....and all this he does in a maximum of 1 and a half hour for 30 answer books. This is done by around 20 % evaluators who comes for evaluation.
> 
> 2. To be an evaluator the university ask every evaluator to fill a form which contains a maximum of four subject that the evaluator has taught in the current semester.....this form need to be signed by the hod and the head of the institution also......now the beauty is very few teachers teaches more then two subject in college but in these forms most of the evaluators fill four subjects....now imagine four subject for centre A and four subject for centre B which mean they know 8 subjects and thus makes them elligible to check copies of 8 different subjects...coz if one subject answer books are over then they can get the next subject issued....
> 
> 3. Approx. 80 % of the evaluators do not prepare a solution nor do they know the solution.....they are just giving average marks.....that is the reason why the students writing anything get marks and often pass the exams.
> 
> 4. Most of the senior and sincere teachers do not go for evaluation....the people doing evaluation are primarily those who are on consolidated salary getting anything between Rs.20,000/ to Rs. 30,000/- as salary from there parent college....so they find it as an opportunity to earn some extra money.....just imagine that there are evaluators who earn around Rs. 50,000/ or even more during evaluation......this should explain most of the reasons....
> 
> 5. The fact is very few evaluators actually evaluate the answer books....90% of evaluation is done with just the monitary benefits associated with it....so until the university takes some serious counter measures .....this will continue to happen.....

[Non-Political],https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1xb2ni/could_someone_give_me_advice_on_approaching_an/,17,46,alphonse23,"I am not Indian. Said Indian girl is a coworker. I work at an American tech company (Indian coworkers not surprising). I'm pretty sure she is Indian Indian (not American Indian) based on her style of dress -- so very likely either she moved here for a job or went to grad school here and accepted a job here and stayed (which seems to be a common scenario amongst many Indian tech workers).

She does this really unusual thing where she goes to the break room, drinks water from a new cup, then throws it into the trash (somewhat dramatically) -- wasting a perfectly clean styrofoam cup that's only had water in it. (Which I consider very wasteful -- it's a styrofoam cup and it's non-biodegradable). It seems a little unusual, but I’m not sure, it could be normal behavior where she comes from.

Though…

My feelings certainly wouldn't be hurt if she wasn't interested. The only reason why I feel the need to approach is because when I first started working at this company there was a lot of eye contact (her fault -- my fault -- IDK). And I have been getting the distinctive feeling that she'd like me to talk to her (though I'm not really sure).

So, what's an acceptable way to start a conversation with an Indian women? From reading about India on reddit and elsewhere, I've heard the culture is very chauvinistic, and that women shouldn't walk alone at night, and that generally woman are off limits in most cases. I’ve heard this from both non-Indians and Indians. And also heard that relationships between men and woman are usually arranged by their parents (and I think Gandhi practiced this, though I don't think it's common practice today) – and so maybe this is why there are no acceptable ways of approaching females.

I’m not trying to be offensive and I don’t’ mean to sound ignorant – but I feel like this is the only way to really gather acceptable cultural practices – through word-of-mouth and anecdotal, folk experiences. 

I'm only asking what's an acceptable way of approaching (as in starting a conversation) with an Indian female -- that could possibly be romantic in nature (I hate saying this..), but without any possibility of coming of as offensive, or as harassment, or in anyway seeming as ""negative"" in intentions.",False,Non-Political

Now, this is the only place where I applied, so not getting in will be difficult even though I'm quite confident that I'll get in.

I come from a reputed school and junior college (Smt. Sulochanadevi Singhania School) with what I consider sub-par marks (64% average in 11th, which is the marksheet I had to submit) and I need some help with this interview, especially from someone who has hopefully gone through the same process before.

Now I don't know anything at all about interviews and I have many questions (how ironic) and I'll be very grateful to have them answered. My questions mainly revolve around a general interview and not ""what questions do they ask"" or something like that. The things that I am sure I have covered are my attire and myself. However, there are things that I doubt very largely.

.


What am I supposed to bring to this sort of interview?

.


If I'm supposed to bring a Portfolio, what should that contain? In what format? I'm absolutely clueless.

.


On a scale of 1 to 10, how much can I ""brag""? 1 being ""I am educated"" and 10 being listing all my talents, anything I have ever achieved in life, proficiency in Premiere Pro and Photoshop, etc.

.


How do I convey that I am more than that piece of paper? How much should I keep to myself?

.


I'm not too artsy, so how fancy should my portfolio look? Is a simple, plain, printed text sheet enough? (I'm really good at editing though, so I can handle digital stuff well)

.


How much weightage do my board marks carry? I scored well in 10th and stayed afloat in 11th and 12th. I'm hoping that my 12th boards will be reflective of my intellectual value, so I'd also like to know which standard is looked at more specifically or if it's looked at as a learning curve.

.


I might ask more questions later, so I'd love it if you could answer. Nonetheless, thank you so much for reading this anyway.",False,Non-Political

1. Anurag Kashyap (AK) had apparently alleged yesterday that Pahlaj Nihalani (PN) & Co. had not given them their decision including the list of required cuts in writing. PN just said in an interview that AK & Co. were scheduled to collect it yesterday (June 7) morning. However, they did not do so and later in the day went to the media and said that CBFC had not given them the certificate. Now, the same has been collected by them today.

2. AK said that CBFC ordered them to remove 'Punjab' from the film title. PN says they never asked AK & Co. to change the film title and that AK is only doing that for publicity. 

And now for some extremely shoddy reporting from India Today (IT) (which I had some respect for before today):

A. PN specifically said in the interview (which IT showed like a hundred times continuously like every Indian news channel always does) that during his tenure, 72% of the films have been allowed without any cuts. India Today reported that PN claims that CBFC has approved 72% of Udta Punjab.

B. AK had made some wild allegations against PN including stating that he (PN) was a megalomaniac. PN unequivocally stated that he hasn't met AK after Bombay Velvet. IT, grossly twisting this, reports (quoting PN) that PN has NEVER met AK.

Now, yesterday, I was insanely furious against PN & Co. after watching my favourite director's (AK, not PN) passionate appeal in the interview. However, if I had watched only IT reports without having seen the interview, I would be fully pissed and transform into my keyboard-warrior mode against PN & Co. However, the shoddy reporting by IT makes me a bit skeptical about how much of this whole story, as portrayed by AK & Co. and the reporting by IT (usually), is exactly as true as they say it is.",False,Non-Political

The real life issues of  reactions of different family members, difference in opinions, some compromises in traditional value, concerns of extended family and how they come about to achieve a middle ground none of which was  depicted in a proper way. It was borderline racist sometimes without being apologetic even when there was absolutely no requirement for scenes like that. And no, that never increased the humor quotient of the movie which was already as low as the film maker's standards.  To summarize, it  was as if a hollywood romcom was made about interracial marriages where the family of the whites gifts fired chicken to the blacks and the blacks would get them all some guns  as gifts because they are from Texas.

Some of the subtopics I am most curious about are:

1) radio broadcast in India (popularity/demographics of listeners, types of shows, are they generally profitable? Does the Indian listener prefer Desi music or a wider variety?)

2) music industry: It is common knowledge that the most popular music is likely associated to Bollywood, but I wanted to know if there was an independent music culture as well? How do musicians typically make music outside of the film industry?

3) what kinds of TV shows are most popular? What American shows are popular in India? Are soaps/serials popular amongst the youth? How is Aamir Khan's satyamev jayate amongst the youth? Are there other similar shows as such?

4) Networks: what are some of the powerhouse network companies? what networks are popular amongst young adults?

5) News. how do young adults get their information in India? what news channels are popular/reliable?

6) Do young folk read the newspapers?

If there's anything you personally find interesting about the industry, I would love to hear it! Thanks for the help, this is the brainstorming session for what I hope becomes an interesting paper. Thanks in advance!

I was pleasantly surprised when I got a reply in a few hours (way before their 24 hour wait period for emails). They promised me that the couriering will complete in time and they will prevent any such issues from happening again.

I ended up getting two Bluedart and one Fedex package in the next couple days. This is the *first time* that Bluedart has been able to “find” my address, LOL!

Let me also add, this Amazon email I got as a reply was one of those rare customer service emails that didn't sound self-defensive but really genuine and helpful—when something wrong was pointed out against the company.

I'm of Indian origin, so not really white or anything, although I'm pretty pale, but regardless, still look Indian. Anyways, I'll be in Delhi for the most part and was just wondering how safe it is. I kind of want to be away from my family as I'm 17 and well you know how it is. Anyways, I speak English as my only language, although I can speak Hindi, just with a very western accented voice, and I can understand most of it. Anyways, are there any genuine safety concerns or anything of that nature? Will I be treated differently because of my voice? I'm a pretty big guy (almost 2 metres) tall so I'm not like tiny or anything either if it is indeed dangerous. Also, what are some suggestions for someone like me to do? I'm at a complete loss but I don't get to visit India too often, so I'd like to do something with my short stay here. Thanks!

Escuse me for bothering you with a travel related question. Furthermore I understand that some of you are tired of 'westeners in yoga pants'. Please understand that I am not visiting your country out of an idea that you are nothing more than a spritual country.

With this said I am seeking your advice.

I am an european male travelling to India in about a month time. I have heard many good stories from friends who have been in your country. I will be in India for about 6 months (October - April) I think. If money and desire suffices.

I want to experience India as a country; culture, food, people etc. But one of my main plans is to find a good place for yoga. Ideally I would find an ashram where I could stay for 2-3 months. Maybe, if it's possible I would like to do a teacher training course, mainly because I want to deepen my own practice but maybe, some day, I could be interested in teaching.

BUT when I try to find places online it is really hard to determine the quality of the courses and, of course, I do not like being ripped of/wasting my time.

As I understand there are many places in India for yoga. Rishikesh, Varanasi, Mysore are the main ones that I have come upon.

I almost decided on not booking anything in advance and then travelling to a yoga city to find a course.

In this regard, do you have any advice? Cities? Specific ashrams? Ways to approach this?

I have tried in /r/yoga . I have tried different yoga forums. I have tried google. All without much result.

* Pagan traditions and Semitic religions are fundamentally different manifestations of religiosity. 

*  Traditions are difficult to proselytize because they do not consider other traditions as false. 

* Semitic religions believe that some religions are indeed false and so encourage and facilitate conversion. 

* The Indian state sees Hinduism as just another semitic religion. 

* The Indian state by allowing conversion is working within a Christian theological framework. It is not being neutral.  



Full length:

In India, we have two different kinds of religions: Pagan or Dharmic or Indic traditions (Hindu, Jain and Buddhist traditions) and Semitic or Abrahamic religions (Islam and Christianity). 

Hindu traditions exist because they are passed down from one generation to the other. Such traditions do not actively seek converts because they do not entertain the notion that other people follow false gods or have false religions. 

Such traditions see things like devas or puja pr bhakti as familial or traditional practices. They are followed in order to maintain some continuity between different generations, not because they contain some grand and timeless truth. The practioners of such traditions might try to justify their actions (a Durga bhakt would say that she is worshiped because she killed a powerful demon).  Such justifications are mostly offered to outsiders (non-bhakts or non-hindus) and are not theologically consistent. 

Observing ancestral practices need not be justified logically just as there is nothing logical about writing a sonnet using just 14 lines. Why 14? Its just tradition. There is nothing scientific or logical about it. 

 Semitic religions (namely Islam and Christianity) spread partly as ancestral practices and partly through conversion.

 Islamic and Christian theologians try (not always successfully of course) to be logically consistent because they  think that they are after some grand and timeless truth. Using the God-given faculty of Reason, they want to understand the nature of Creation and the Creator. Conversion makes sense to Muslims and Christians because they think there are false religions and false gods. And the people who worship such false gods will be punished after they die by the True God. To save the “heathen”, Muslims and Christians are encouraged to engage in proselytization and conversion. 

The heathen needs to be saved from his own spiritual blindness.
 

Indian secularism is defined as equal respect and equidistance from all religions. The secular state sees Hinduism as just another Semitic religion with an internally consistent theology containing a singular grand Truth. So a Brahmin is just another kind of Priest, and Gita another kind of “religious” text like the Quran. Having confused tradition with religion, the Indian state allows for proselytization thinking that it is possible to convert people from one tradition to the other. 


By allowing proselytization and conversion, the Indian state has accepted that:

1.	There are some True gods and some False  gods.
2.	It is possible and necessary and understandable that people can be “saved” from eternal damnation for worshiping false gods. 
3.	Hindu traditions can compete financially and theologically in the “marketplace of damned souls” on a level footing with Islam and Christianity.
  
None of the above statements holds up to  **neutral scientific scrutiny** . Do humans have souls? Can souls be damned? Are there True and False gods? Do Islam and Christianity contain some timeless truth? 

Within the framework of Hindu “theology”, the notions that there are false gods and that you can be punished for worshiping such goads do not make sense.

However, all of the above statements make sense within the framework of Christian theology. 

Faced with two completely contradictory theoretical positions (there are some false gods and there are no false gods), the Indian state cannot be neutral. It either allows conversion (as it has done for the past 60yrs) and accepts the semitic notion of false gods, heathens etc or it bans conversion and gives undue advantage to pagan traditions. 

Faced with two very different kinds of religions, the Indian state cannot afford to be equidistant or show equal respect.

317,comakt,[AskIndia] What song is this ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/comakt/askindia_what_song_is_this/,6,6,lockworm,"Often when I think of home there is a particular Hindi pop a song plays in my head that was popular in the early 2003, the year I left home. I can recall only one line from the song and hum the tune of the same bit and nothing more. Over the years, I, for the life of me can't find the title of the track or singer. I've trawled through a several 2000s pop songs compilation on youtube, lyrics websites without much luck.

What I can remember: 

* **Genre**: Hindi pop song
* **Singer**: Male, lean and tall (at the time of filming)
* **Year**: 2003 or 2001 (A ""hit"" song during the month of CBSE board exam)
* **Lyrics**: (Not chorus) It goes by *kore kagaz ki tarah, adhoori (khali?) meri (hamari?) kahani hai* the next line is sung in the same tune. That is all I can recall. 
* **Music Video**: Filmed indoor with large open space, maybe just walls (dark) in an open field with no roof. Heavy wind blowing into the singer's face and all over the place (as you do). The singer wears sunglasses (totally unnecessary), dressed in black and he features in most of the video. He is stood in front of the car on occasions. The whole video has a dark blue hue and borderline black and white. 

That's all I can remember unfortunately. Frustratingly the song has been on the tip of my tongue for a fair few years and with every passing year it gets harder to bear the fact that I may die (not terminally ill) without ever being able to listen to this song once more. 

**TLDR**: Can't bear the fact I may never be able to find the song that reminds me of home and childhood memories.

Please advise.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bdfid1/ambassador_of_india_takes_back_my_newly_issued/,14,27,FrustratedOCIHopeful,"Hello /AskIndia!  First time poster, long time lurker here.

&#x200B;

Brief background: My wife is Indian and I am Canadian, and we have been so excited to finally visit her family in India this summer. I applied for the OCI 11 months ago per her request to make it happen. The application never went smooth, but that was never expected, as goes this story for most OCI applicants. We properly submitted all our documents, and each month like clockwork, we receive additional requests from the Indian Embassy for ""extra"" documents that weren't requisites on the OCI application checklist. We happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality, no questions, just documents. 11 months go by since we submitted everything, and finally we get notified that my OCI card was ready for pick up at the Indian Embassy. Just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to India!

We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds) . When we finally get to the Embassy, we sit down with our consulur,  who strangely didn't greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting.  She hands me my OCI Card, its receipt, and asks my wife to sign document a declaring that she agrees to forfeit my OCI card to the Government of India in case of my death or divorce.

However, things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn't open up specifically for my OCI file.  She stands up, picks up my passport and brand new OCI card, leaves her office to meet with the Embassy's  Ambassador and only returns with my Canadian passport, not my OCI. She said the Ambassador is in a bad mood and suggests that I  fill out and pay for new application.

Excuse me, what? I've never seen or met the ambassador. What is happening?

She explains that my OCI file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018, and because it's currently 2019, there were ""crossed wires"", thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my OCI.  My wife and I make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the Embassy, so they can have a hard copy. She said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution, as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn't in a good mood, would be to fill out and pay for a new application. Back to square one, 11 months down the drain. We are confused, just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can't have it and we need to start again.  We politely try to press her for more information, and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her OCI contacts in India to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card, but not to be optimistic.

What is going on here? Any advice would be much appreciated.

My main goal is to avoid any inadvertent rudeness on our family's part. 

 

So we have some neighbors from India (we're in the U.S.) and they have a daughter around the same age as ours (preschool). The two girls have become good friends and play together several times a week. Whenever their daughter comes over to our house, she brings a snack with her, and politely declines anything we offer her while she's here (they're Catholic, and do not have any dietary restrictions from what they've told us) which is usually fruit or crackers, never junk food. Whenever our daughter goes over to their house, she ALWAYS comes back with food of some sort. Sometimes its a small snack, sometimes its something more elaborate. They've also brought us food on a couple occasions too (always delicious). We've had them over for a meal a few times, and they eat sparingly.

&#x200B;

My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. But I want to make sure we're not somehow being rude. Growing up, if I went over to a friend's house, their parents would give us snacks/drinks. Similarly, if friends came over to my house, my parents would offer food/drinks.

I am from Central Europe and in a 1.5year relationship with an Indian woman. Without going into too much detail, we are pretty sure that we fit very well together, but the problem is that she is from a very traditional family (arranged in-caste marriage) who she loves and is loved by.

Understandably, she does not want to 

1. Hurt her family's standings
2. Cause her family grief and pain
3. Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.

I can secure her a safe, free life (be it in India or in Europe) with a near-guarantee of a loving, supportive husband. 

I want to make this happen, but knowing that she would never hurt her family like that, meaning she will ultimately marry another guy, I feel conflicted as to whether this relationship should go on.

I would appreciate any opinions on this. Especially from people who have been in that situation or who know what other ways are there for us to be together without hurting the family and its standings.

-------

""Letters To My Ex"" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.

I think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of ""Notes From The Underground"" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.

Anyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.

The original book is located here:

-----------------------------

These are my notes:

# On the Book

This books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.

As the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.

She panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. 

# January 
There's a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.

Then we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, ""Do you like being ignored?""  Rolls her eyes!

And then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?

# February 
From a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  


There is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.


Yes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else's fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.

# March

This is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.

She has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.

Needhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. 

# April
The first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that ""I don't know"" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.

She talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, ""Where do we go from here""? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. 

After having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika's kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.

# May
May is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.

Then there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.

Then there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that's that. 

# June
They have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.

She is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.

There is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.

#July 
The one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi's need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi's talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!

Needhi's friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don't know how things already are!

Then finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.

# August
She has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won't. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.

Abhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.

She felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.

# September
She is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.

She admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.

The one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.

# October
She finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.

Trust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. 

Even though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.

# November
Abhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.

Abhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.

Their idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It's not conditional, it's a contract.

# December
She feels 19 again.

They have a set of promises one is about playing devil's advocate.

They are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing! This almost reads like an episode of Sillicon Valley.

I am a 26 year old guy in love with my girlfriend from college in India. Both of us are working outside India in the same city. I am from Rajasthan and from Agarwal community. My girlfriend is belongs to a scheduled caste and is from Maharashtra. Both of us obviously don't care about the caste system.

Now my parents are against our relationship. They hate SC people in general. Some of the reasons they are opposing the marriage 

1. It will tarnish their prestige.
2. It will lower their standing in the community.
3. It will be difficult to find a match for my younger sister (7 years younger)
4. My entire extended family has hopes from me. (I don't understand this one either :P)
5. I don't know the best for me, they do.

Now I understand that they are orthodox and probably had dreams about my future wife. I don't expect them to change their views quickly (may be they never will).

What I actually want to know in case they never accept my girlfriend and I decide to marry her:

1. Will it really affect my sister's wedding?
2. What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

They are willing to pay me $1000-$2000 for a month of initial work. There's also a possibility of getting more work if they get seed funding.

I am worried about the tax return filing next year. Up until now, I have only filed ITR based on Form-16 from employer. Never had to worry about foreign payment for services provided.

Should I file ITR-4 in 2018? 

Or can I just mention it as ""income from other sources"" under ITR-1?

They are also willing to offer me some equity. Don't know how international equity compliance works, so if any of you have any experience, that would be helpful.

Once corona patients are admitted to hospitals, no communication is received till the patient dies or recovers.

If the patient dies, he may not even get reason as covid 19 in his death certificate since state government are trying to suppress deaths. But whole of his family is forcefully taken into quarantine centre. Their house is locked and left unguarded. Many robberies are taking place due to this.

If relatives happen to become corona positive, they will be admitted to hospitals and same process as above will repeat.

Government does not have a clear plan on what to do with corona dead bodies. If they hand over it to relative, they are unable to carry the patients to their home or near by funeral centres due to corona stigmas.

If there is no nearby funeral centre, even hospital would not want to take risk of taking care of cremation. Hospital also would not want to use those dead bodies for lab.

If the family recovers from corona, they are not allowed back to the village/society, even though, they are showing certificate of recovery from the hospital. They are forced to go in hiding.

I am currently in my 25th week (late 2nd trimester) and I'm trying to educate myself about what lies ahead for me. I have to zero in on the most important decision - the city of birth (job city?/my hometown?/husband's hometown?). I need to decide this ASAP as traveling after 28 weeks(April end that is) is generally not advised.

Which brings me to making this post here. I want to gather all the information/anectodes/experiences, in a countdown way, about the D-Day/D-weeks. If the circumstances allow, I would prefer a normal delivery. However, I totally understand how uncertain pregnancies can get. I just feel being informed can help us stay less anxious & not panic. Its going to be long and my thoughts might seem all over the place, so please bear with me. Here are my questions:

1) How frequent are the scheduled* OB/GYN visits in the very last month, assuming a normal pregnancy? Currently I visit once a month, for routine check up and milestone/mandated tests (flu vaccination, various blood tests, sonography, etc)

*(By scheduled I mean no complication was experienced by the woman or any urgency(water breaking, bleeding, etc) occured)

2) One lady who had the same OBGYN as me when went for her scheduled 37th week visit, was told she will have a C-Section as the child is getting overweight (weighing 3 kgs then). The OBGYN asked her to soon decide which date she would like the surgery to happen and let the doctor know. The lady said she however got labor pain the very next day and delivered via vaginal delivery. Now, I am a little skeptical here; from what I've read, **2.5-3.5 kgs is the average birth weight for newborns in India**. How can 3 kgs be overweight then? I'm already very paranoid about the state of deliveries in urban, big-name hospitals and this incident scares me more. There is no data public on the number of normal and surgical deliveries a hospital has, so that one can decide, and once you're in, you're in. After that, you have to leave everything at the doctor.

3) One lady who delivered at the same hospital (different OBGYN) as me, went at 37 weeks when she felt contractions. Her cervix was examined twice in a 5 hour span. She said she couldn't bear going through that painful examination again and asked for a C-Section herself (totally fair). My question is, are these cervix examinations by hand so necessary, when they're leaving the bearing lady in pain? Is there no other way (imaging, ultrasound, etc)? My point is those contractions could have been what is called 'false labor' and if not for the pain due to the examination, that lady could have gone home and come again full-term or when she felt contractions again?

4) My sister went for a scheduled visit in 38th week. Her cervix was examined, she started bleeding. She was told to come back if bleeding continued till evening, which it did. She had to be operated the next day, after staying in labor room for some 24-32 hours. This again makes me skeptical about cervix examinations.

5) What's the countdown going to be like? When does one know that ""yes, its now that I rush to the hospital."" Should I be scared of just a few drops of blood? Should I rush the very first time I experience period like cramps? From my few interactions with mothers, I feel 37-38 weeks is the sweet spot where many things happen. I know my post gives a lot of distrusting vibes towards doctors, that they're there to loot us, they try to 'invent' some complication in these sweet spot weeks to push for C-Sections, etc. Trust me, I would like to be proven wrong. Hence, I'm here to collect as much anectodes about false alarms, doctor sending the lady home even after mild contractions as its not time yet instead of asking to schedule a C-Section, etc as I can.

5) From what I understand, some women might never experience labor even after 40-41 weeks and hence have to be induced. Are some women induced before that too? What could lead to induction before full term?

6) Do all women having a vaginal delivery get an epidural/other pain medication, or only those who demand it when they get tired, or when they can't bear pain?

7) Did anyone research natural birth centers? There are many in the major cities, like 1) Sanctum Birth Center, Hyderabad, 2) Birth Village, Kochi, 3) Daimaas Natural Birth Center, Mumbai, 4) Apollo Cradle, Gurugram. Google reviews are mixed. Anyone undertook the services of these natural birth centers?

Over the last few years, I have been earning a lot more money than before and I want to use some of it to help others who aren't as fortunate.

Currently I am sponsoring the education for 2 siblings with a single mother and few other small donations which I don't even need twice to say yes to. 

Most appeals for financial help that I come across on social media are well within my means to help, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to spend my money. 

This post  is mostly to help me decide what kind of efforts I should be funding. So I can set aside funds for such causes and whenever I come across an appeal, I shouldn't have to think about whether I should donate or how much etc. 

I would like to donate to things that can significantly change people's lives for the better. (Beyond just helping them survive/maintain status quo.)

Things I don't feel comfortable sponsoring, 
 - Expensive school education(pre-classX) for under privileged kids. (Expensive = 20-30k per annum, I don't mind funding someone's college education for a lot moret, but I feel  it's super expensive for school fees.) 
 - Expensive medical treatment for strangers with low chances of survival. (I'm conflicted on this, but my thinking the same amount of money can help a lot more people instead of feeding into medical industry profits. I may think differently if it was a family member or close friend.)

A few things really stood out. For example -

1. India has a unique MRP system for products found nowhere else in the world. It gives us the illusion that we are charged fairly for our goods but it works very counter-intuitively against the poor.
Because the rich pay almost the same price as the poor. A richer neighbourhood should have richer prices than in a poorer neighbourhood.
The manufacturer has to price the MRP at a rate higher than he would in a competitive market because he needs to make sure he covers his cost or overruns due to dead or destroyed stock.

2. How we, as Indians, value money over time. We would not pay for quality which saves us time but we will gladly buy sub-quality goods if it saves us money.

3. We question and probe profit percentages of each private company but have no clue about the efficiency of government spending and yet we keep clamouring for more taxes.

4. Pre-1991, we were poor and ridden with Socialist policies which championed the poor and the farmers and we went bankrupt. But after 1991, when we allowed foreign money to come in, we saw a substantial rise in the standard of living and goods.
Yet, we are still calling restrictions on foreign capital in e-commerce and retail which is just perplexing.

5. We think the private companies are out to loot the people of India and we think Adani and Ambani are rich because of Modi but it is, in fact, the lack of competition and implementation of endless rules and licenses that allow Adani and Reliance to operate in any field with almost no competition.

It's a case of social withdrawal, where young people just stay indoors for years and years. They don't go out, or work (becoming NEETS - Not in Education, Employment, or Training), or socialize IRL. Their whole lives just revolve around the apartments they stay in (some alone, some with their parents).

Their reasons can vary - fear of societal disappointment, anxiety, depression, heartbreak, etc. It has much to do with the work culture of Japan, with its insanely long working hours, high expectations, conformity, and rigid social rules. I'd suggest reading about [Hikikomori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori) and checking out some of the IAMAs done on it. And the anime, Welcome to the NHK.

**Now, the point: would you say that this is happening to some degree in India as well?**

Some of the factors that cause this are common here. Japan is very different from India so let's get past that bit. However, we do have similarities. Indians are [increasingly overworked](https://qz.com/india/1030594/indian-millennials-are-overworked-and-sick-of-office-politics/) with most of our workers [burning out](https://qz.com/india/1401250/indias-unhealthy-workforce-stands-in-the-way-of-economic-growth/) from unhealthy conditions. [Indians are lonely](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-04/india-obsession-with-sons-millions-of-lonely-men-after-dowry/7903134) and many millions will, statistically, die alone. This is not to count the actual problem that we have no dating culture in India, and the fact that most men are unlikely to be well-socialized with women - who then watch movies about romance and start to wonder why their lives don't match up with what's on screen. Indian male loneliness is crippling, and prevalent, in my opinion.

Like Japan, we also have strong family structures, so that an unemployed youth staying at home and slowly rotting away isn't uncommon. In fact, in Kerala, I would say every family has one. There are cousins and uncles - people who for unexplained reasons end up doing nothing but staying at home. We have people who strike out into depression after failing the IIT-JEEs and AIEEEs or back papers, who stay home and seldom if not never come out. I'm sure many have posted on this subreddit as well. 

**One strange parallel I feel we have with the Hikikomori is the IAS aspirant**. There is a degree of social isolation and staying-at-home-for-years that happens with both IAS aspirants and Hikikomori that really strikes me. OFC not all IAS aspirants are the same but I know one shut-in and one on his way to becoming one, perhaps. Anyway this is just my view.

What do you think, though? Are a lot of young Indians locking themselves away from society as well? Have you ever felt the urge? Any discussion appreciated. 

I write as someone who's been unemployed for a good year now and I can feel the yawning chasm of social reclusion approach. Most of my year was at home, though I took gaps to travel. This was more a recluse from my career than from socializing, though I do feel I've been meeting fewer new people than I normally do.

* LLP or Private Limited are better than OPC (why?)
* LLP or PL need 3 people, while OPC needs one and one for nomination
* register company, get some secure USB token
* register trade marks (but no idea how to register different company names and products - like One97 and Paytm) for apt classes (35 to 45) or in all of them
* dedicated Office : needed or not?
* GST, VAT, etc :  what's needed and when?

I find it baffling to see a lot of South Indians on Social Media vociferously supporting RSS. In a Hindi-Hindu Rastra they are ethnic minorities with second class status.

Before anybody comments shit instead of discussion, 

A) I'm a 5th Generation Maharashtrian (that I know of) and 3rd Generation Mumbaikar aged 41. So obviously I'm not a Muslim or a Pakistani posting here. Its sad that it has come down to this that one has to prove his Nationalism for any freeminded discussion. We all let it happen, it's our fault not of Bhakts.

B) Not a Dalit but a Chitpavan Brahmanvad, so I can claim My Hinduism to any Hindutva turd and tell them to back the fuck off, in real world. I'll show my clout and power to those, if and when need arises. Because that's not relevant here and i'm just clearing this for stupid and ignorant Bhakts.

Now, since that part is cleared, I definitely am not a supporter or a fan of Dawood or his chain of gangsters ever. Dawood was just a name whom every gangster wannabe wanted to have that kind of power that he had in his time of late 80s and 90s. Everyone as a kid used to mock himself as Bhai or Dawood gang leader just for fun. That was the kind of cult Dawood had in his prime, the mumbai underworld king. Look at any big international gangsters stories and Dawood was no different. From actors to politicians, businessmen and builders, Gold and Diamond merchants and every small or big scale citizens of India was affiliated with Dawood once directly or indirectly. During that period, only the Law enforcement and Cops gave actual shit to pin his empire down and common citizens never gave a fuck about it, like how the common people are doing now but it is pointless since he is overseas or Pakistan or wherever he can easily travel.

I'm positive that he had hands on Mumbai serial blasts, everybody thinks that because some cops were sure of it based on tips and infos. But that's that. Finito. No hard evidence to back up the cops theory cuz it's obvious he didn't plant those bombs himself. His minions did. And those minions of his used some 3rd party to do the dirty work, similar to lower class poor needy should shitbag. So one cannot even prove that it links to Dawood based on hard evidence. There is none. It's only a feeling that we think Dawood did it. No matter how much We as citizens believe that he did it, our Judiciary will still not be convinced and will let him go Scott free. Because it happened 25 years ago. Ofcourse Dawood will not come down and will confess, not will his supporters or even his enemies will do it too. Because even his enemies hates cops and law and order. A common ground between every rival gangster is that to keep cops at Bay. So nobody will ever come out and will be a witness. Chotta Rajan? Hahaha....he was once a part of Dawood gang, so whatever he will claim will come down to him as well. To be honest, he is no good use to the courts as he himself is a criminal with so many cases against him.

Ofcourse he has knowledge of Dawood a whereabouts, but how much really does he know since 5 years have passed and Dawood is still nowhere to be traced. Even if he is located, how will anybody bring him to India? And even if he is nabbed, what will be the charges? How will he be put behind bars cuz so far not a single chargesheet has been made against him, criminal or otherwise. He is still well protected by his old friends who are old politicians, actors and businessmen who are much too afraid that whatever criminal charges will be put against Dawood, it will all be linked to them, one or the other ways.

So how is he a Terrorist, Criminal and Most Wanted? When in reality nobody wants him in India or else all hell will break loose once he starts to reveal all the dirty secrets. Which current politician wants that? Why would these Rich people wants a noose on their neck to bring Dawood back? To end Terrorism for good, these Rich people will sacrifice their 29 years ""good"" image?

Another thing is, what Dawood did back then, is the very same Sadhvi Pragya was charged for. Serial blasts that is. Now she is in Modi government. Because the Lawyers got her out. Because it's Lawyers job to defend. And they won't do the same for Dawood if the price is right? So it is safe to say Dawood of he gets nabbed and sent back to India, he will get out Scott free. It's only that the BJP has put an image that since he is a Muslim and is in Pakistan so he is a Terrorist. What they will never say is , Dawood is a free man in India even today but if Dawood chooses to reveal all the secrets, no politicians, Actors, Actresses, Businessmen images will be safe. And he would have done that if he was really going to get nabbed. But he is most definitely not. Our CBI is smart enough to get Chidambaram and all, but not him? Please.

Hello all, My sister got a 49,000 rank in JEE Mains with Delhi domicile. She has got MAE in IGDTU till Round 1, but hasn't been upgraded till Round 3. Our options below in order of choice filling - 

1) IGDTU - ECE Electronics - I was expecting her to get this till round 3 but haven't till now, so a bit worried

2) NSUT - MPAE Manufacturing Process & Automation Engg - Very difficult to get considering last year cutoffs - may get only after Round 4

3) DTU - MAM Mechanical & Automotive Engg - May not get - high cutoff

4) NSUT - BT Biotechnology - Not a lucrative branch, but I have preferred it over other slightly better or similar branches of DTU because of lesser number of students (= better chance of getting placed)

5) IGDTU - MAE Mechanical & Automation Engg - Allotted

6) DTU - PIE Production & Industrial Engg - All of below branches are almost alike in placement scenario as all of them have very less/poor Core placement options. Students from these branches either go for Software, other Non-core profiles, MBA or MS. 

7) DTU - Civil

8) DTU - EP Engg Physics

9) DTU - Polymer

10) DTU - ENE Environmental Engg

11) DTU - BT Biotechnology

Of late I have been thinking if we should prefer BT, Polymer from DTU (far better college than IG) over MAE (better branch than BT) from IGDTU. I myself am from an IIT but from Civil branch and couldn't get a placement from campus. So I would totally prefer a better branch in place of better college but MAE is not an exceptional branch either. And she won't get IT in IGDTU either. 

Q1. Should I move DTU branches above MAE from IGDTU?

Q2. Considering no. of students, should I keep NSUT BT above DTU branches?

Q3. I have read some post on quora stating that NSUT is better for circuit branches, and DTU is better for rest. How true is that? 

Q4. Is ECE at IGDTU good enough? (if she gets it in further rounds)

Kindly suggest edits to the above order.

Leaving all the privacy concerns aside and various technical concerns aside like IPv4 to IPv6 migration (that has been covered in detail in a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aeblpo/r_please_dont_get_jio_gigafiber_and_i_have/?st=jwpse9tu&sh=4ffb9a21) ), I want to delve into the more mundane or trivial shitty things that come along with Jio Giga connection  

1) what the hell is with the landline, how could anyone be stupid enough to connect the landline with the router, fuck i have to keep the modem switched on a 24*7 or no landline connectivity. these fucktards ever heard of overheating  

2) of course the landline connection is itself a pain in the ass. fucking takes too long between consecutive rings, one might think it even got disconnected after the first ring  

3) the shitty shitty whyphy, motherfucker i want to kill the salesman who said i would be getting 50-60 mbps, the speed that i get is even lower than their low speed data that should be around 1 mbps, fucker reminds me of the gprs/edge days which still might be faster because of low data requirement for the page  

4) the stupidest and tardiest customer service ever, first you have to wait a whoopass 20 fucking minutes on the phone listening to the fucking jio tone or whatever, if that doesn't fry your brains, then the customer service guy/gal will. they are the fucking most typical indian customer service guys you can imagine. For a moment I thought i was in the south park episode with customer support and the vr headset. If you have seen Kenny's and kanan's maa ki dal sketch, then this guy is even worse than kenny. the same guy is the customer support and the floor manager and the technical team and yet they don't know shit  

enough with rant, i had some question for my borthers who got baited  

 * if any jio gigafiber users have figured a workaround for the landline, do tell mate  
 * how is your wi-fi speed, please tell me it gets better  
 * and yes any data hoarder or torrent user, does gigafiber have port forwarding, i have made all firewall exceptions, enabled upnp and still not able to open a port  

edit: i mentioned port forwarding in the last line incorrectly, i wanted to know about upnp support on jio, cause  with most CGNAT enabled isps, asking for static ip's becomes costly, so i had been using upnp to seed which can be easily enabled on the modem webpage. previously i had been using airtel and they had this service, what is the case with jio?",False,AskIndia

Working a decent corporate job. I make \~14LPA. My parents are now retired. I've lived with them my whole life.

&#x200B;

I've had a good upbringing but my main problem has been that throughout my life, my family has been a group of over-thinkers, which has caused anxiety in me (and I'm sure in them) over things like ""What will you do?"" ""What if this?"" ""What if that?"" in every social, career, relationship position possible.

&#x200B;

Till they were working, this was fine, but ever since they've retired, they are finding it tough to deal with such situations. They have a good networth, we own 3 properties (live in 1, rented 1), they have a good corpus in the bank and they've invested money in good mediums. We are debt free. They feel they will run out of money, inflation will eat them up, they won't have food in their old age etc. This leads to fights daily among my parents and I am in the middle of the it playing the referee. In their fights, they demean each other calling out each other's weaknesses and failed ambitions in life. I felt this would happen a few days after retirement, but it's almost been a year now and it's non-stop.

&#x200B;

I do contribute to the house here and there but I feel that it'll hurt my father's ego if I start paying for household expenses. My father restricts a lot of travel to other cities citing expenses. My mom tells me in her fits of anger to ""pay"" for her to travel to other cities. I have volunteered but never followed through cause they never decided to go anywhere. **Are they waiting for me to take initiative / is their ego stopping them from asking / will I hurt their ego by paying?**

My mom has to feel in control of the house. With the timings of the maid to the food brought into the house. Even on the ocassions that my parents are back in their village for a week or two  - it's non stop. She cannot let go of things. **Does she feel she will lose control of the house if I take care of things?**

&#x200B;

There's a fight every second week over something or the other and the parents are not on talking terms for days. They had one today morning as I came to office. **Is this normal?**

&#x200B;

Now, this is leading me to a situation where I am :

1. Worried to make any big spends of my own and having the independence to do so - be it a trip with my friends, maybe a property on my name etc. How do I tackle this when it comes up? I don't want to be in a situation where my mom is like ""we aren't taking that train trip but you are going on joytrips with your friends?""
2. If I get married and live with my parents (Which my mom pretty much expects me to) will this be a conducive situation to start off my married life?  Specially with their fighting and all. How do I draw the line and be clear without hurting their feelings?
3. Has anyone moved out of their parents' house with some level of resentment (before or after marriage) and kept good cordial terms with their parents?
4. I feel a bit burdened and tied down in my house cause of few of the things here and otherwise. I am not always the happiest person when I get back home and look forward to office even though it's dull at times. Is this normal?
5. I have thoughts of getting a new job in another city and moving there alone and starting afresh (easier to change cities than get another house in the city). Is this okay? Does this make me a horrible child for abandoning 60 year old parents at home after retirement?

It is locked, fairly simpering in nature, and lacks any controversy section.

The equivalent entry on [Dhirubhai Ambani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhirubhai_Ambani) is not locked but is also fairly blank in its description. 

Wikipedia is supposed to a neutral entry for human knowledge curated by the community. In instances where an article is repeatedly vandalized or at constant risk of vandalization, it can be expected to be ""locked"" from edits that are not approved by a higher power.

I'm not the first to mention this. One Quora user (in a post titled ""How corrupt is Mukesh Ambani?
"") described his attempt to edit the page and how it was stumped by higher-level editors.

In the case of India's richest and most powerful person, it is understandable that certain information is undesirable in the public realm. However, that does not mean we should bow our heads.

Finding out anything about the Ambani's is notoriously difficult. Sure, you could follow newspaper headlines over the least few years but they have a tendency of being fickle. Remember when Ambani's kid mowed someone over in an Aston Martin? Or when the family was involved in a [bitter feud](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/19890831-bombay-dyeing-reliance-feud-ril-executive-arrested-on-charge-of-conspiring-to-kill-nusli-wadia-816444-1989-08-31) with Nusli Wadia (that culminated in a murder charge)?

The saga of Ambani is too vast to remember everything. Only a person who reads the paper every day for the last 75 years will know their true history and even then he knows just a fraction. I admit, I don't know enough. But I do know that there is a concerted attempt to control information about Reliance.

As of now I have two years of workex, and an acceptance from a top 10 MBA college (1.6LPM Hojaega in a few years). My father however has his own project management consultancy, and is suggesting I join it.
I enjoy the consultancy bit, and the engineering part, but it doesn't pay as well as a Top MBA job would. So now I am confused, primarily because :
1. Dad's company = My company, plus staying at home (I've had loneliness induced anxiety before)  is a big thing.
2. MBA has a huge loan attached (25L+interest) which I need a lot of time to pay off.
3. Even if I stay home, I'll have to get some specialization in my field of engineering. So more padhai, along with work.
4. I can always work and make the consultancy bigger, expand it. 
5. From various people that I've talked to, once you're making good money, it's difficult to come back and start working for yourself.

I think I can speak for many when I say that it's what I turn to when shit gets dark.

I've never really become an Otaku though the last year has been tough and perhaps I've been on the path, as a NEET of sorts. Either ways, I felt there would be some here who would empathize.

One of the challenges of discussing anime is that everyone has their own personal list of must-recommends, and not many seem interested in your own lists. I guess it's like YouTube, everyone has their space and curations.

I've just started watching EVA. It feels nice to go back to the 90s for a change. And while I always perceived this as a 'weeb' anime for some reason, I watched a few YouTube videos on why people love it and realized it's sort of about depression as well. Four episodes in and I can see how compelling this show is.
 
The last anime I fell in love with was Samurai Champloo (which introduced me to Nujabes and the genre that evolved to become Low Fi). I watched that show for the music and the smooth storytelling. I wanted to be like Mugen - badass hardened street rat who's seen the world and is wise to it. But also like Jin, someone who has a deep inner calm. And a bit like Fuu, who creates the adventure, and who knows it's about the journey over the destination.

Starting a thread for people to talk about the anime they watch and how it makes them feel. Like, for example, why do you watch shonen anime - and do you feel it's inspired you to make your lives better?

I could say I am from the foreign country I grew up in and had my childhood from but then LOL that country doesn't give anybody citizenship. And I don't want it even if they paid me for it.

The more I think about it, the stranger the question of where you're from becomes, if you, like me, have no fixed roots. Where are you from if your parents come from two different cities? Where are you from if you spent many years in Bangalore but feel no affiliation to one city over another? Where are you from if you don't speak the local dialect and language of the place you are from?

Isn't the entire point of having traffic rules to avoid accidents and major delays in transportation? And yet everyone seems to be completely oblivious to this and then start cussing at random people with their arse seated in the car wondering how it happened in the first place. Literally no one is exempt from this phenomenon - rickshaws tuck themselves in everywhere, bikes try to slip between vehicles, almost all car owners leave little to no space between consecutive vehicles.

No one seems to grasp the concept of staying in their own lane, if people were caught breaking the signal or speeding above the allowed limit everyone would get stopped one by one - it's just a crazy shit show.

You can say that many youngsters are to blame, but I don't see any elder people following a lot of rules either. It's only when someone goes through a major accident themselves, even after which they will follow only certain rules selectively so as to avoid harm to self.

I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

The taxes on Petrol and Diesel have grown by over 100% in the tenure of Modi government. While the other big economies are trying to ensure that they do not go in economic slump by easing their monetary policy, India is busy dampening consumer confidence.

This news closely follows another one where the Modi government fired Urjit PATEL for not financing 1.56L crores worth of government expenditure.

The markets are reeling heavily downwards under pressure due to C scare, and it is very likely that the investors will pull out their investments from higher risk based emerging economies. In a looming recession, the growth can flee and the institutional investors may pull out in hoards.

The Indian banks are failing and the modi government is further dampening the consumer confidence by raising taxes on staple like Petrol. The recent drop in oil prices was perfect opportunity for the government to announce a reduction.

Please note I'm only looking at the big picture. I'm not trying to minimize the suffering of lakhs, just want to get an overall view of DeMo and its effects on the economy, black money and the tax base.

**The Good:**

* Under the new Amnesty scheme,  ₹4900 crores of unaccounted income was declared by around 21000 people. (Source - [Rs 4,900 crore black money disclosed under PMGKY, Rs 2,451 crore tax collected from it)](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/black-money-rs-4900-crore-disclosed-under-pmgky-rs-2451-crore-tax-collected-income-tax/story/259891.html)
* Over 2 lakh shell companies (corporations that exists only on paper and are often linked to money laundering and movement of black money) were struck off by the government, rendering them illegal. (Source - [India Cancels 2.24 Lakh Suspected Shell Companies Post Demonetisation](https://www.bloombergquint.com/law-and-policy/india-cancels-224-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation))
* In similar but separate action, around 3.09 lakh board of directors were disqualified for their companies failing to file financial statements and/or annual reports for a continuous period of three financial years. (Source - [Govt cancelled 2.24 lakh suspected shell companies post demonetisation, disqualified 3.09 lakh directors](https://www.firstpost.com/business/govt-cancelled-2-24-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation-disqualified-3-09-lakh-directors-4194085.html))
* 48 per cent increase in deposits in Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) accounts, with addition of 18 million accounts post-demonetisation (November 9 to January 25, 2017). The latest data indicate that 38.2 million new accounts were opened until July 26, 2017 since demonetisation. (Source - [Demonetisation and Bank Deposit Growth](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/MSM_Demonetisation.aspx))
* India witnessed a great jump in the account ownership during 2014-2017 as 80 percent Indians owned a bank account in 2017; there were only 35 percent bank account holders in 2011. Please note this is in(significant) part due to the PMJDY accounts. (Source - [55 percent of all new bank accounts in the world opened from India: Global Findex Report 2017](https://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/19-crore-indian-adults-do-not-have-bank-accounts-global-findex-report-2017-1524203973-1))
* Several measures taken to improve transparency in the gold market, including GST have seen a shift from off-book transactions to accounted transactions (Source - [Demonetisation, GST impact: India is fast ceding gold market share to China](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/demonetisation-gst-impact-india-is-fast-ceding-gold-market-share-to-china-118050300388_1.html))
* Much more transparency in the real estate segment which is rife with black money dealings. DeMo paved the way for new acts such as the RERA which further increase transparency. The immediate drop in the prices in real estate (\~30%) can be attributed to black money not playing such a big part anymore (Source - [Demonetisation impact: Real estate sector still recovering from the jolt](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/demonetisation-impact-real-estate-sector-still-recovering-from-the-jolt-2432723.html)). The real estate segment seems to recovering from the jolt, but now with much higher accountability. (Source -  [Impact of demonetisation on real estate recedes](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/impact-of-demonetisation-on-real-estate-recedes-117061400058_1.html))
* Direct Tax collection has increased siginificantly due to DeMo. Corporate income tax grew at 14% and Personal income tax grew at 13%. Net collections increased by 17.1% in FY18 and 14.6% in FY17, despite income tax rates staying mostly the same in the last couple of years. Since the note ban, direct tax buoyancy doubled from 0.6 times in FY16 to 1.3 times in FY17 and accelerated further to 1.7 times in FY18.  (Source - ['Direct tax collection up since demonetisation'](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/direct-tax-collection-up-since-demonetisation/articleshow/69077749.cms) and [What demonetisation did to tax collections](https://www.thehindu.com/business/what-demonetisation-did-to-tax-collections/article23550004.ece))

**The Bad:**

* Labourers in the textile, footwear, plastic and metal industry have been adversely affected by the demonetisation move.Labourers in the organised and unorganised sectors bore the biggest brunt of this move. In the time since the note-ban, over 50 lakh men have lost their jobs. The unemplyment rate hit a 45-year high of 6.1 percent in 2018. (Source - [50 lakh people lost jobs since demonetisation, says Azim Premji University report](https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/jobs/50-lakh-people-lost-jobs-since-demonetisation-says-azim-premji-university-report/story/337980.html))
* In the immediate aftermath of DeMo, MSME's were the most badly affected. Small businesses with no access to PoS machines suffered during the immediate aftermath. This inadvertently led to the bigger players overpowering the market. (Source - [Demonetisation: Indian SMEs suffered a blow, still struggling to find their footing](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/demonitisation-indian-smes-suffered-a-blow-still-struggling-to-find-their-footing/articleshow/61541952.cms?from=mdr))
* The manufacturing segment was hit pretty hard. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 49.6, indicating a contraction. Cash flow issues battered the entire sector, leading to lower employment, reduction in production activity and rise in input costs. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) saw just a 4.9% growth in November, compared to 6.6 percent in October. (Source - [Demonetisation hits manufacturing sector](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Demonetisation-hits-manufacturing-sector/article16979062.ece))
* Agriculture was one of the worst hit sectors. The Ministry of Agriculture acknowledged that due to the lack of cash, millions of farmers were unable to purchase seeds and fertilisers ahead of the rabi season. Due to the shortage of cash, about 1.38 lakh quintals of wheat seeds of the national seed corporation were not even sold. Sale, transport, marketing and distribution of ready produce to wholesale centres or mandis, is dominantly cash-dependent. Disruptions, breaks in the supply chains feedback to farmers as sales fall, increased wastage of perishables, lower revenues that show up as trade dues instead of cash in hand and when credited into bank accounts with limited access affect the sector. Incomes and profit margins were hit hard. (Source - [Demonetization: The impact on agriculture](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/B1vFTOgwqHjdM5nkmg2CxJ/Demonetization-The-impact-on-agriculture.html))
* The rural and informal economy suffered disproportionately as most of the transactions are cash-based. The pile up at wholesale markets lead to a sharp decline in the Wholesale price index (WPI) of perishables in the immediate aftermath of DeMo. (Source - [How demonetisation affected the Indian economy, in 10 charts](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/ySbMKTIC4MINsz1btccBJO/How-demonetisation-affected-the-Indian-economy-in-10-charts.html))
* A systemic liquidity crunch was created due to the note ban leading to massive disruption in the supply and demand of several goods. The performance of the equity markets saw a sharp reversal, but recovered quickly enough. (Source - [INDIAN DEMONETIZATION AND THE LIQUIDITY CONUNDRUM](https://insight.factset.com/indian-demonetization-and-the-liquidity-conundrum))
* Economic growth slowed to 6.1 percent, a loss of 2-3 percent. Please note we were already on the cusp of an economic slowdown and the subsequent measures such as DeMo and GST further aggravated the issue. (Source - [Demonetisation hit growth by 2 percentage points: US Study](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/demonetisation-hit-growth-by-2-percentage-points-us-study/articleshow/67154320.cms))

**The Ugly:**

* Poor were left unbanked and were left in the lurch. They suffered significantly. Delay in wage payments, drop in incomes and loss of employment disproportionately affected the poor due to their reliance on cash. (Source - [Hitting the bottom](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/hitting-the-bottom/article9992462.ece))
* Unemplyment soared significantly to 45-year high of 6.1 percent between July 2017 and June 2018. It is estimated that 33 lakh people permanently lost their source of employment.(Source - [Life after Demonetisation: How India's poor are still paying the price](https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/life-demonetisation-india-poor-paying-price-190614135641262.html))
* It directly/indirectly led to death of around 100 Indians. (Source - [Indian Banknote Demonetisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Indian_banknote_demonetisation)).

A couple more points I'd like to add:

* Just because **99.3%** of the cash in circulation prior to DeMo has returned to the system doesn't mean that the excercise was a complete failure. The issue of black money was tackled on several fronts. I believe the main point of DeMo was never to take out a significant chunk of currency out of rotation (despite what the government says). I believe the government got everyone on the black-money bandwagon as a way to make people feel that they personally were helping in the fight against black money. Again, just my theory.
* I believe the true purpose of DeMo was to bring **more transparency and accountability** to the economic system, in addition to making more and more of India **tax compliant and a part of the formal economy.** I do believe that the informal sector plays a very important role, particularly in the times of economic crisis, but that's a story for another day.

Summing up, I'd like to point out that DeMo can neither be categorized as a success or a failure. It has its place, in the grey, neither black nor white as some people believe. That's the point of my post. Thanks for reading.Please let me know if I missed anything and I'd be happy to update my post.",False,Policy/Economy

Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world, and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government. With economy already slowing down before Covid impact, and now in a state of paralysis, several promising startups will go under water, unless they receive investments. 

China is a key investor in several prominent Indian startups that lot of Indians use, from Paytm to Zomato, Byju’s, MakeMyTrip, Swiggy Ola, Big basket etc though Chinese holding companies like Alibaba, Tencent etc. [Chinese firms have invested over $4 billion into Indian startups](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/with-4-billion-chinese-investment-desi-start-ups-wary-of-fdi-policy-tweak/articleshow/75228027.cms). Many such startups rely on Chinese funding and now will find it harder to access investments. Investments from US companies into Indian startups have already been slowing down, and during the global pandemic any source of investment that can keep promising companies from failing should be welcome. Instead the govt thinks otherwise. 


After China picked up additional 0.2% stake in HDFC, Indian govt reacted swiftly, without thought, by banning regular investments from countries that India shares a border with. China has already slammed this move, as it is against World Trade Organisation's free trade practices, India could be exposed to sanctions. With an already failing economy, this can deepen the crisis, leave several startups out of money and lots of people who work in the startup space without jobs and livelihood. 



Key question to ask are:

1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC. Yet China owns huge % of Indian startups and thus can exert control on these companies, as well as access data of Indians. 

2. What kind of thought was put into this decision? It's clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies (as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy). But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required? 

3. What kind of relief will India provide to its startups? Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes. Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster, billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs. Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further. In this situation, is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?


Many Indians have been celebrating the news of banning Chinese investments as if this is good news for the country. No it is not. It is stupid, unplanned and achieves no real purpose. Huge Indian listed companies like HDFC cannot be taken over by China so easily, while China already has lot of control on Indian startups, due to existing investments. Govt could have smartly brought about anti-takeover laws instead of outright banning all Chinese investments. Instead this govt has shown its foolishness again, and with scant thought has enacted a rule that will spray gasoline on an already burning economy.

Read details below",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g141sz/economists_of_rindia_can_you_give_your_views_or/,7,2,ParmanuMan,"Recently , I was reading an article on inflation and unemployment

>A.W. Phillips was one of the first economists to present compelling evidence of the inverse relationship between unemployment and wage inflation. Phillips studied the relationship between unemployment and the rate of change of wages in the United Kingdom over a period of almost a full century (1861-1957), and he discovered that the latter could be explained by (a) the level of unemployment and (b) the rate of change of unemployment.

>Phillips hypothesized that when demand for labor is high and there are few unemployed workers, employers can be expected to bid wages up quite rapidly. However, when demand for labor is low, and unemployment is high, workers are reluctant to accept lower wages than the prevailing rate, and as a result, wage rates fall very slowly.

>A second factor that affects wage rate changes is the rate of change in unemployment. If business is booming, employers will bid more vigorously for workers, which means that demand for labor is increasing at a fast pace (i.e., percentage unemployment is decreasing rapidly), than they would if the demand for labor were either not increasing (e.g., percentage unemployment is unchanging) or only increasing at a slow pace.

Does this mean the current government's quest for low inflation is indirectly leading to unemployment going up .

Low inflation means companies and investors have no initiative to invest . However during times of inflation , investors look for places to invest their money in since it will keep on losing its  value if it kept ideal .

During Congress years of 2004-2014 , high inflation also most probably lead to increased consumer spending and expenditure. Since a large sector of Indian economy is dependent on internal consumption , it experienced significant growth due to it 


The reserve bank of India has been also extremely focused on fighting inflation . Many people are saying that this obsession with inflation is causing them to keep interest rates too high , as a result of which private companies have no initiative to borrow loans for new ventures


>As these examples of hyperinflation show, states have a powerful incentive to keep price rises in check. For the past century in the U.S., the approach has been to manage inflation using monetary policy. To do so, the Federal Reserve (the U.S. central bank) relies on the relationship between inflation and interest rates. If interest rates are low, companies and individuals can borrow cheaply to start a business, earn a degree, hire new workers, or buy a shiny new boat. In other words, low rates encourage spending and investing, which generally stoke inflation in turn.By raising interest rates, central banks can put a damper on these rampaging animal spirits

Context:

The Prime Minister, while announcing the lockdown had to decide between saving lives and ensuring livelihoods. He rightly privileged the former over the latter then. As India nears the end of the lockdown period, the serious damage to the economy and livelihoods is beginning to make itself apparent. The editorial talks about various measures to manage the unprecedented crisis on the economic front.  

Issues:

There is tremendous pressure from industry bodies to opt for a nuanced policy that will help economic activity to restart.
They fear a collapse if activity is stopped for another fortnight.
Lives could be lost to hunger and livelihoods sacrificed in the lockdown.
Way ahead:

One way to sidestep this existential dilemma is by bringing on a second round of an economic relief package that goes well beyond the first both in terms of the financial commitment and the spread. 
The ₹1.7-lakh crore package announced by Finance Minister was a good start but barely accounted for 1% of GDP. India should spend at least 5% of GDP for now — about ₹10-lakh crore. 
The cash transfers to the poor should be hiked to at least ₹3,000 a month for the next three months. This should be in addition to free rations and cooking gas, as was announced earlier.
Out-of-the-box ideas for delivering support and also for raising the required funds might be required. 
The government should let go off fiscal conservatism and go all out to spend and support the economy. Economists are unanimous that there is little option now but to print money and spend (what the developed countries are doing).
In the harvest season, farmers need logistical support for moving their produce to markets.
Lenders, including NBFCs, should be granted freedom to reschedule their loan accounts so that borrowers are not under pressure to repay for fear of turning delinquent. 
A credit guarantee fund that will support non-delinquent borrowers for the next six months will be a good option. 
Such a fund can be financed through a domestic bond offering. 
The bankruptcy code should be suspended for the next six months, at least for MSMEs. 
A GST holiday for the next three months would be a good option.
The loss of revenue will be ₹3-lakh crore at worst, but in reality will be much lower than that because economic activity is at a standstill now. 
Such a move will ease cash flows for business and also obviate the need for statutory compliances at a time when the focus will have to be on getting businesses back on track. 


Conclusion:

The crisis now is without precedent and the solutions must not be conservative. Generous support from the government, and quickly delivered, is the need of the hour.",False,Policy/Economy

what the budget and Economic Survey are saying. Source: am research scholar in Economics. 

1. Listen to the whole budget speech or read the transcript online (usually available on a ministry website after a few hours). Dealing directly with the budget speech is the best way not to be swayed by random claims.

2. Filter through the hawa-baazi. A good chunk of the budget speech will be dedicated to singing the government's praises. Ignore all of that; the budget is as much a political speech as it is an economic one.  Do make a note of what they claim to have done though, in order to cross-check later. 

3. Most crucially, listen to how they intend to fund any new schemes. Are they going to increase taxes? Will they just give out loans via PSBs? Do they hope to draw on CSR resources? Will they divert funds from existing schemes?  There are typically two parts to the budget speech: Part A and Part B. Part A is mostly what they intend to do, Part B is mostly about how they intend to raise the funds for it; i.e. the taxation tweaks. Part B in my opinion is more important, as the how of these schemes is as important as the why. 

4. Listen to multiple commentary sources. Big business interests will obviously praise any budget that makes their life easier, and will also obviously praise the government in general to facilitate easy business. Thus: question anything that they say without highlighting specific plus points. The same applies to government critics, professors etc: They (myself included) have biases that lend themselves to automatically assuming the worst of any decision made. 

5. Don't overhype the budget. Between data manipulation and upcoming elections, the budget is no longer the significant economic blueprint that it once was. The same applies to the Economic Survey. It is important, but no longer sufficient to gauge the direction of the economy and the government's economic policies.",False,Policy/Economy

Access to good quality internet has never been more important than right now. With most experts unanimous on the need for  social distancing and many workplaces putting into place work from home plans, voice and data connectivity become critical. To ensure that high quality bandwidth is available to all parts of India we have suggested specific steps to be taken by the Department of Telecom. 

### ""We the people..."", of the Internet

Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Union Government is taking various policy measures to safeguard the health and welfare of all Indians as per an advisory by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare titled, “*Advisory on Social Distancing Measure in view of spread of COVID-19 disease*” ([**link**](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/SocialDistancingAdvisorybyMOHFW.pdf)). Point number 3 to this advisory recommends to, “*Encourage private sector organizations/employers to allow employees to work from home wherever feasible.*” A “work from home” measure is critical during this time to contain adverse economic impacts on individuals, companies and the entire Indian economy.

At the same time during this period many people are likely to undergo mental stress and will reach out to loved ones for comfort and support. Even for children, remote educational modes of learning will become vital at this time as schools are closed. Many such interests which require social distancing necessary to restrict the spread of Covid-19 are supported by the availability of telecom and data services. However, as is the case with such a measure we would like to highlight that there comes certain network capacity related risks which policymakers must respond to. 

A recent report in the New York Times, dated March 16, 2020 informs us that a work and learn from home set up, leads to considerable stress on underlying network infrastructure ([**link**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/technology/coronavirus-working-from-home-internet.html)). This is because last mile home service networks are designed to handle traffic patterns which are considerably different to enterprise grade internet broadband networks. Moreover, Wi-Fi based home internet systems have their own set of challenges in terms of reliability and quality of service. 

### We need to have a plan to support each other

We urge for crucial policy measures by putting forth a comprehensive plan in coordination with appropriate government departments and ministries. We specifically suggest the following:

1. **Periodic reviews of telecom infrastructure** **constraints:** There is an urgent need for the DOT and TRAI to conduct assessments in consultation with large telecom and internet service providers on the capacity to carry voice and internet traffic. Separately, there's a need for authorities to engage with representatives from internet users both enterprise facing stakeholders and consumer facing stakeholders in challenges they may face in continuing their day to day activities online. All of these actions must nonetheless, uphold the spirit of net neutrality and not lead to discriminatory treatment of internet traffic.
2. **Encourage voluntary pledges by telecom companies:** We recommend that a voluntary pledge may be encouraged by the Union Government in which telecom and internet service providers decide to not terminate services of any residential or small business users because of their inability to pay their bills due to disruptions caused specifically by COVID-19. 
3. **Ensure full and complete access at all times:** We urge that an advisory may be issued to all State Governments to halt any internet shutdowns or actions under the Telecommunications Suspension Rules, 2017 which are likely to increase hardship for people and organisations. This includes measures which slow down internet access speeds since that has the potential cripple economic activities.

We urge people from across the community (especially technical experts and small businesses) on if they have experienced any difficulties whilst accessing the internet, or using voice and video conferencing services. IFF will remain alert to the situation should it develop.

**Tl;dr**

IFF has responded to the call for public comments and suggestions by the Joint Committee on the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill, 2019 and sent across a submission on behalf of the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. In it we have provided substantive inputs on essential privacy principles and a thematic analysis of major issues with the Bill. We have also appended a public brief containing a high-level clause by clause analysis of the Bill. Additionally, we have appended two issue specific briefs on (a) workplace surveillance and (b) the relationship between the PDP Bill and the National Population Register.   


**Essential First Principles**

As a first step we apprised the Committee that since the right to privacy as recognised by the Supreme Court also includes informational privacy this should be the primary lens through which the eventual law should be framed. In this regard, we also mentioned that the Supreme Court in the right to privacy judgement (*KS Puttaswamy v Union of India*) made the observation that the right to privacy subsists in public spaces as well. In this regard, we highlighted that a lot of users’ experiences online occur in certain corners of the internet which are public/semi-public in nature. Therefore, India’s data protection law must respect that and therefore accord adequate privacy protections in these domains  


In addition, we noted that the Joint Committee could shape India’s data protection law to incorporate the [**seven privacy principles**](https://saveourprivacy.in/principles) of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 which was developed by the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. These principles are based on the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision in KS Puttaswamy v Union of India and global examples like the European Union’s (EU’s) General Data Protection Regulation. The seven privacy principles emphasise that individual rights should be at the center of privacy and data protection and that the government should respect user privacy. They also address the need for the creation of a strong supervisory authority; and for surveillance reform.   


**Major Concerns that should be addressed by the Committee**

Subsequently we have done a thematic analysis of our top substantive concerns with the PDP Bill. This includes but is not limited to themes such as:  


*1.    Inclusion and treatment of social media intermediaries in the Bill*

The Bill requires social media platforms identified as “significant data fiduciaries” to set up infrastructure which allows users in India to voluntarily verify their accounts. This measure hampers online anonymity and thereby the right to privacy. Additionally, it will allow social media entities to access people's government issued identity documents. This can lead to aggregation of demographic information across different social media companies and databases. This creates immense scope for companies to build granular user profiles and commercialise personal and sensitive personal data of individuals. **We therefore ask the Committee to remove this provision from the PDP Bill**.  


*2.*   *Need for a chapter on surveillance reform*

Presently, India does not have sufficient privacy safeguards in place when it comes to surveillance carried out by the government. The frameworks currently in place (under India’s Information Technology Act and the Telegraph Act) are geared towards national security and fail to adequately protect privacy. In particular there is a lack of sufficient institutional or legislative oversight. **Thus, we have proposed that there is a need for a separate chapter on surveillance reform in the Bill along the lines of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018**.  


*3.*   *Exceptions for central government to access non-personal data*

A provision in the PDP Bill (Clause 91) provides a carve-out for the Central Government to access anonymised or non-personal data to frame policies in the interest of its digital economy. Such provisions show that the proposed law is far more interested in treating data as a resource. **We believe that a data protection law should not be used as a legislative backdoor to commodify data**.  


*4.   Issues with proposed structure of the Data Protection Authority (DPA) and the accompanying appellate structure*

* The selection committee consists of secretary-level officials. Two issues that arise here are of: i) accountability (these are neither democratically elected nor judicial members), and ii) diversity (it doesn’t reflect executive, judicial and external expertise). **Thus, we have proposed having an open call for applications and for the selection committee to have be inclusive in terms of representation**.
* We have noted that the Bill **impairs the independence of the DPA** by allowing the Government to frame policies which will be binding on them.
* To ensure quicker and localised decision making, we have proposed having **state and regional DPA benches**.
* We think that as things stand, the Appellate Tribunal would lack transparency. To that end, we have **proposed that it must publish all its decisions**.   


*5.*   *The “reasonable purposes” exemption which allows personal data to be processed without consent for reasonable purposes under Clause 14 of the Bill.*

The exemptions granted under this clause are fairly wide. It classifies publicly available personal data as under the “**reasonable purposes**” category. We think that this is a backdoor towards profiling and allow collation of demographic/individual sentiments on issues. We also think this would allow the government (and other powerful data fiduciaries) to aggregate social networking activities without the need for individual consent. The right to privacy is applicable in public spaces. Therefore, we proposed that this **provision be removed from the reasonable purposes exception since it is an excessive encroachment on people’s privacy in public spaces**.  


In addition to these themes, there are also other major issues with the Bill that we have discussed at length in our submission. The #SaveOurPrivacy collective has also authored briefs and explainers on different areas of the PDP Bill. We are sharing them with the JPC, the public and other relevant stakeholders in the hope that our analysis can inform future outcomes.

### Tl;dr

IFF has prepared a public brief highlighting the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance. Technologies like CCTV cameras, location tracking and device monitoring have made it possible for employers to turn workplaces into a panopticon, and such pervasive surveillance undermines the dignity of labour and the ability of workers to unionise. We encourage you to read the brief and participate in the consultation being held by the Joint Parliamentary Committee to ensure existing power imbalances between workers and employers are not exacerbated by the Bill.

### Your boss shouldn't be Big Boss

Much has been written about the exemptions provided under the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 for governmental surveillance but there is another form of surveillance which the Bill permits that we should all be worried about. Clause 13 of the Bill exempts employers from seeking consent prior to processing personal data of their employees for recruitment and termination of employment, provision of services and benefits, verification of attendance and performance assessment. With advancement in technology, employers now have the ability to continuously monitor the real time activity of their employees through CCTV cameras, location tracking, device monitoring etc. By allowing employers to track bathroom breaks, lunch breaks and meetings of employees, such technologies pose a threat to the dignity of labour and the ability of workers to unionise. 

### Recommendations 

In order to ensure that any workplace surveillance is strictly need based, context specific and minimize intrusion into the personal lives of employees, we recommend that the following changes are made to the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019.

1. The principles of necessity and proportionality should be included under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019.
2. A mandatory obligation should be imposed on the employer to consult employees and seek their views prior to processing personal data under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019.
3. The Data Protection Authority should be entrusted with the responsibility of issuing a Code of Practice for workplace surveillance under Clause 50, PDP Bill 2019.
4. The Code of Practice for workplace surveillance issued by the Data Protection Authority should impose a prohibition on monitoring of any unionisation related activity and prescribe penalties for the same.
5. Trade Union affiliation should be categorised as sensitive personal data under Clause 3(36), PDP Bill 2019.

### Read the public brief and engage with the JPC

For more information, we encourge you to read our public brief on the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance. The brief highlights the impact of workplace surveillance on the fundamental right to unionise guaranteed by Article 19(1)(c) and the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. It further explains existing provisions relating to workplace surveillance under the Bill and discusses their pros and cons. Following from the earlier discussion, the brief finally recommends five changes to the Bill to ensure that the existing power imbalances between employers and employees are not exacerbated by pervasive workplace surveillance.

If you are a trade union or employee association which needs more information about the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019, please feel free to reach out to us at policy@internetfreedom.in. We encourage people to share this brief widely in their circles and participate in the consultation being held by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Bill.

524,c95ykl,I read the Indian economic survey of 2018-9 so you didn't have to. Here are the highlights,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c95ykl/i_read_the_indian_economic_survey_of_20189_so_you/,94,46,MelodicBerries,"The biggest take-away was the direct attack on what the survey calls 'Anglo-Saxon economics'. Basically the concept of a general equilibrium theory. Instead it claims an economy is always within either a 'virtous cycle' or a 'vicious cycle'. 

A virtous cycle is characterised by rising investment, rising exports and rising savings. A vicious cycle is the inverse of that. 

The implication is that the government must intervene to steady the ship and any fantasy about 'rational actors' has to be abandoned.

The importance of higher savings cannot be underestimated accoring to the survey. It is only with high and rising savings that a country can **self-finance** high investments. Otherwise it must seek out foreign savings which gets translated into a high current account deficit which in turn makes it vulnerable during times of crises. 


They survey continually made mention of China and other fast-growing East Asian economies when making its case in countless graphs. It is clear what the chief inspiration is. 

Having very high savings naturally means having a correspondingly low domestic consumption. Thus, the only way to have fast growth when domestic consumption is subdued is through fast export growth. They survey made the case that because India still has a low share of world export market so there is plenty of scope to regain, regardless of trade tensions.

The survey made many other recommendations, of which judicial reform is one which caught my one, but the overriding theme of the survey was the call to abandon 'Anglo-Saxon economics', by which it meant general equilibrium theory.

There are no two ways to put it, India’s tax on the super rich is ridiculously high. I belong to that super rich community and while paying taxes is not an issue, the amount certainly is. Money doesn’t come easy and I’ve worked hard for it. Meanwhile the government just gives us a big middle finger and increases the taxes. 

Now tell me why would anyone want to live in a developing country with such high tax rates. Before any of you’ll hark on about patriotism and bullshit like that just think logically for a second. For the amount of tax (42.7%) paid here, you can easily shift to a country with lower tax rates. And with the kind of money people from my income category have I can see a lot of them leaving this country for good. 

The government is not incentivizing individuals to become wealthy. What benefits does being wealthy in India get you? Roads are shit, public infrastructure is lacking, incredibly high taxes for luxury items, the list goes on and on.... 
Instead they want to spend my money on statues, stupid ministries like AYUSH, scams, bailing out public sector companies and stuff like that.

Worse, so much money, which I GAVE as tax is being spent to appease the vote bank. Rich farmers are not taxed because the government is afraid to lose them. The individuals and companies who pay taxes (the 1%) have absolutely no say in policies because the government wants to use the money to appease the other (99%). (The figures are just examples). We are the source of that money. India is taking a turn to the socialist era, when taxes were even more exorbitant and India was a planned economy. I just wish the government would aggressively try to increase the tax base instead of strangling those who pay tax.

EDIT- I am NOT averse to paying high taxes in general. I already elaborated that in my comment below but in India, tax does not give benefits that other countries with similar tax rates give.",False,Policy/Economy

527,e5d76w,Real Talk: India's economic future is screwed and no one can do anything about it,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5d76w/real_talk_indias_economic_future_is_screwed_and/,22,8,mrfreeze2000,"I'm starting this based on an assumption: that the only way for lower-middle income countries like India to prosper is through a manufacturing-led, export-oriented economy.

This is the only proven model of prosperity in the 20th and 21st centuries.

This manufacturing can't be just any kind. It has to be low skill, high-volume in order to employ a large number of people. India's current manufacturing pattern is mostly filled with high-skill, low employment products like jewellery, medicine, cars, and software.

It's far easier to train 10,000 people to make iPhone accessories than it is to get them to make cars.

But this kind of high-volume, low skill manufacturing isn't coming to India, regardless of any policy push from the government. 

A few reasons why:

&#x200B;

1. Competitors in SE Asia a) have specialized in certain products (like garments in Bangladesh), b) have fewer roadblocks to investment from the populace (they are autocracies or pseudo-democracies), and c) have a cultural affinity with China (such as Vietnam) which makes it easier for Chinese manufacturers to move shop there.
2. Businesses are built on relationships, not just policy leverage. Policy makers don't get this because very few of them have ever run businesses. By now, American businesses have had decade-long relationships with their Chinese manufacturers. These Chinese manufacturers are now building factories in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. If you were an American business, who would you rather partner with - an unknown entity in India, or the Vietnamese arm of the Chinese manufacturer you know and trust?
3. Supply chains are hard to build and harder to optimize. If you wanted to be a manufacturing power in 2020, you would have had to start work for it in 2015, not 2019. We've lost that moment.
4. India's regional inequality means that the states with cheap labor (Bihar, UP) are also the states where no one wants to invest in because of law and order problems
5. India's democracy means that everything becomes much more challenging for a manufacturer - land acquisition, labor issues, etc. Vietnam, meanwhile, can bulldoze whatever the hell it wants to bulldoze and put up a red carpet for manufacturers.
6. And this might be a biased personal take, but I've felt that Indian manufacturers don't have business competence. I've tried to build products in India as well as China. Our Chinese partners treated us as a small company that might later be a big company, and gave us that respect and priority. Our Indian partner treated us as a small fry and was more keen on getting short-term profit than build a long-term relationship.

I feel that the moment where India could be a manufacturing power is past us. 

Without manufacturing, you'll have a situation where:

&#x200B;

1. The state has to spend more and more on welfare to tackle unemployment among a young population
2. To pay for this welfare, the state will increasingly overreach in tax collection. You're seeing this already where a small section of the population pays nearly all the taxes.
3. The small portion of people who have good jobs will be increasingly resentful of their taxes being spent on welfare. This, coupled with environmental issues, will accelerate brain drain and capital flight.
4. Without the capital and manpower, employment generation will be even slower, forcing the state to squeeze even more. If the welfare dole stops, it knows there is going to be widespread unrest. 
5. All this welfare will tax the state exchequer more and more. We're seeing this already - the government has hit its fiscal deficit target for the year in just 7 months. 
6. One the welfare dole stops, tens of millions of unemployed, angry, poor people will only do what they can do: revolt.

1) Lack of new job creation, decrease in purchasing power, negligible increase in either headline inflation or core inflation, 2-3% gdp growth rate, if we calculate gdp using previous base year, has substantiated that we are or are heading to recession. Recession doesn't always mean negative gdp growth rate. 

2) Uncertain and draconian policy : Fast changing policies which have proved to be bereft of commitment by actual spending and pervading religious divide and ideology is eating away a part of budget.

3) Infrastructure projects underway, but for whome? Bullet train, statues and home creation, but none of them are infrastructure investment which will help economy at scale and will come out to bite few years later.

4) Migrating tendency : Large mobilisation by semi-elite and educated group due to ease of getting residential cards given that you are competent. It should increase by substantial amount after global economy slow down is over and again will bite back later due to the fact that with lack of skilled man power fewer companies will invest


Deflation & Lack of buffer and misguided policies

5) Corporation tax cut : Current situation is because of lack of purchasing power even among those who are employed and even a cursory glance at past will tell that India has never seen tickle down Impact so I don't expect increase in PP 1) It will fail to attract new investment 2) Goods may get cheaper which will lead to deflation.

6) Possible Deflation : With lack of buffer and policy failure, we will spiral down to deflation and products will get cheaper but people will start losing jobs at hitherto rate.

New minted currency as catalyst to breaking economic cycle and perhaps for even worse 

7) Bottleneck Inflation leading to stagflation : Demand will stay the same or may even increase while infrastructure will be severely lacking and to boost economy, we may see new minted currencies and it will lead to rising prices(inflation) but job loss will still stay the same 

8) Lack of foreign investment : Above should be enough to deter any large FDI flow.

Id first like to clear something up. I’m NOT against mandatory  CSR. I personally don’t like the very idea of mandatory CSR but since it’s law, our company fully complies with all CSR requirements. It’s just the way the government is amending it to make non compliance a criminal offense that is problematic. Let me explain: 

When a corporation is profitable, it pays corporate tax. On top of that, it generates jobs and wealth for individuals and provides valuable goods and services. This boosts the economy. When companies do CSR, they are essentially doing social service and there is nothing wrong in that. 

The problem is why the bloody hell does the government want to criminalize it? I know that non compliance is an issue but this just makes it an additional headache for companies. The compliance officer may not have the same view of CSR as companies do and will eventually end up harassing us. Since there is no concrete framework for CSR i.e. what is and what isn’t CSR, it is largely open to interpretation. And if the government puts another bureaucrat they’ll have absolutely no idea on CSR. 

In fact, I don’t even understand why the government is doing this. The last time I checked, CSR compliance is at 91.25%. There are certain policies (such as the tax on the super rich) which is vote bank politics but this effectively starts an ‘inspector raj’ all over again. 

And if companies have left over money for CSR, we have to deposit in an escrow account after 3 years?! We are not criminals. We WILL eventually use that money.

534,dgsy6w,My take on Decline of Indian GDP Growth rate and current state of Economy.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dgsy6w/my_take_on_decline_of_indian_gdp_growth_rate_and/,4,1,PristineAmbition,"according to the world bank growth of Chinese Economy during most troublesome years of depression were double digit and even skyrocketed as we can see below.

Year : Chinese GR - Indian GR (for comparison)

2005: 11.4% - 9.3%

2006: 12.7% - 9.3%

2007 : 14.7% - 9.8%

2008: 9.7% - 3.9%

2009: 9.4% - 8.5%

2010: 10.6% - 10.3%

as we can see Chinese kept their double digit growth in the worst economic crisis of the 21th century while in today's world India cant even Manage the growth rate of 5%.  so this idea that Indian Economy is tanking because global recession is bull, its result of the disastrous economic policies adopted by the 2014-2018 Government.

at least under UPA government Economy bounced back and achieved even higher growth rate after 2008 but under NDA government our economy growth rate is under sharp decline, instead of capturing this once in century moment when western factories are leaving China in search of more affordable and friendly market, we are doing everything we can to destroy our economy.

imagine what will happen when this recession will become a depression in the future if one of the major bank in either India or Western World collapses as most of economists are predicting, i have a feeling that new generation will get his hardest as there are fewer jobs and more manpower (already) and with this slow growth there will be even fewer jobs available for the college graduates in near future, due to lack of experiences they will be first one to get booted if companies will start cost cutting. these depressed young educated class of people will either become a nationalistic bunch of people(Bhakts) or turn India into complete anarchy with revolution.

The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time. Now, indirectly asking, on whom will the institutes push over this liability of 90,000 crores? Its the students, and the pricing of courses**. While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets

&#x200B;

**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

Coal in the United States is a dying industry. Coal mines in West Virginia and Wyoming have long been [closing](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/west-virginia/articles/2018-10-13/large-west-virginia-coal-mine-with-400-workers-closing) their doors, and total coal consumption in 2018 is close to half of what it [was ](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37692)a decade ago. It is likely the coal power plants will struggle to survive without [subsidies](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/06/06/donald-trump-hopes-to-save-americas-failing-coal-fired-power-plants). However, it would be a mistake to assume that coal is a dying industry. Many large countries, including India, Indonesia, and China are rapidly increasing their use of coal. In today's podcast episode, I will be exploring India's coal industry, focusing on the struggles of Coal India, the public sector enterprise that dominates coal mining, to dig up enough coal to meet India's demand, the inability of coal and other extractive industries to bring development to the regions where they are most active, and the implications of India's increasing use of coal on the global environment.

Coal India Limited, a state controlled mining company that [controls ](https://www.coalindia.in/DesktopModules/DocumentList/documents/Annual_Report_&_Accounts_2014-15_Deluxe_version_In_English_03102015.pdf)82% of the coal market, has dominated coal mining in India since its creation in 1971. Coal India has struggled to meet the demands of India's rapidly growing economy because it is expected to provide coal to power plants at costs well below global market levels. Coal India was forced to sell coal at prices 70% below market [averages](https://www.ft.com/content/9233696a-8323-11e1-9f9a-00144feab49a), reducing Coal India profits by half. Similarly, Coal India has long [subsidized ](https://www.brookings.edu/research/indian-railways-and-coal/)passengers on Indian Railways by paying above market rates to transport coal. Coal India is legally obligated to hire all of those its mines displace, and strong unions command wages that consume [half ](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/coal-india-high-wage-bills-cast-a-shadow-on-coal-majors-numbers/articleshow/13617713.cms?from=mdr)it revenues. Moreover, corruption and mismanagement at the highest level have resulted in windfall gains to connected companies of [$33 billion](https://saiindia.gov.in/english/home/our_products/audit_report/government_wise/union_audit/recent_reports/union_performance/2012_2013/Commercial/Report_No_7/Report_No_7.html) . A violent and powerful coal mafia has [emerged ](https://in.reuters.com/article/india-coal-jharkhand-dhanbad-coalindia/special-report-coal-mafia-stokes-indias-power-crisis-idINDEE94D00B20130514)that skims money off of each stage of coal production and distribution, with ""Goon taxes"" rising as [high ](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajes.12208)as 10%. The combination of these factors means that Coal India does not have nearly enough money to invest in mechanization and new technologies. Labor productivity of Indian miners is only 4% of that of those in the US, and only 1 in 10 mines are [mechanized](https://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/what-s-keeping-india-dark). The result are severe shortages in coal that act as a serious break on rapid [development](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/indian-govt-grapples-to-find-causes-of-coal-shortages-2018-11-26).

A problem just as severe as Coal India's inability to produce enough coal for the Indian economy, is the fact that coal and other extractive industries have failed to bring prosperity and development to the regions in which they are concentrated. A vastly disproportionate share of India's coal reserves are located in the states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. These states are the home of around 8% of India's population, but [over ](http://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Energy%20Statistics%202019-finall.pdf)two thirds of India's coal reserves. India's iron ore, bauxite, and copper reserves are all disproportionately located in these [states](http://www.jsmdc.in/web/AvailabilityofMineralsinJharkhand.php). However, these three states are also among the poorest in India, with rates of GDP per capita, and human development metrics such as infant mortality substantially worse than the [national average](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/AnnualPublications.aspx?head=Handbook+of+Statistics+on+Indian+States&fromdate=03%2F02%2F2019&todate=03%2F04%2F2019). Moreover, despite wealth of natural resources, these states have seen substantially lower rates of growth than the national average. These disparities are especially striking that many mines are located in adivasi or indegenous lands.

India's coal industry has consequences that extend well outside of India. India is forced to rely upon coal imports as Coal India has failed to met [demand](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/adani-expects-india-coal-imports-to-hit-record-1557467616076.html) in India.

More important is the Indian coal industry on global climate change. While India is still taking [part ](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2017/jun/01/donald-trump-paris-climate-agreement-live-news)in the Paris Accords, it has made promises of only modest cuts because coal is so central to its development strategy. To be clear, India is investing massively in solar and wind power. Total installed capacity of wind power has more than [quadrupled ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_by_country)over the last decade in India, and 5.4% of India's electricity comes from solar power, a proportion more than [double ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_by_country)that of the United States.

Over the last decade India has grown only more dependent on coal, as the percent of electricity generated from coal increased [from ](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.COAL.ZS?locations=IN)66% to 75% between 2007 and 2015.

While per capita carbon emissions are well below the global average, carbon emissions are increasing at a rate over 6% a year. Reconciling India's need for development and environmental concerns will be vital for fighting global warming.

India's coal industry is highly inefficient, a poor engine for raising standards of living, and dangerous to the planet. Nevertheless, the coal industry remains vital to the future of India's economy. Coal fueled the industrial revolution in 18th century England, the rise of America in the 19th century, and the spectacular growth of China in the 20th. Coal is likely to similarly, for better of for worse, likely to play the same role in the development of the Indian economy in the 21st century.

541,azoh6g,"Suddenly, ‘one nation, one policy’ sentiment is overtaking other models -Interview with YV Reddy, IAS, former RBI Governor and 14th Finance Commission Chairman",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/azoh6g/suddenly_one_nation_one_policy_sentiment_is/,6,3,Avinash_Sharma,"You have said in your book that there is a feeling in some quarters that cooperative federalism is being replaced with coercive federalism. What is the basis for this comment?

>Some developments have taken place after the 14th Finance Commission’s (FC) recommendations. Cesses and surcharge have increased significantly, even after GST. The States felt that they were being short-changed by the way the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were restructured, increasing the share that the State government has to put in and then the way the GST is being administered. The general debate earlier was about the Bihar model competing with the Gujarat model and different States’ models of development competing with each other.

>Now, suddenly the “one nation, one policy” sentiment is overtaking the other models. And the Planning Commission, which was a forum for States, is also not there now.

>Due to this institutional vacuum, Ministries are directly dealing with CSS. So, the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various Ministries. Some say that there is no dialogue, which is untypical of cooperative federalism.

You’ve said that States are now forced to share more from their own resources in CSS. After your own 14th FC recommendations, the impression was that the Centre was devolving more to the States as it went up from 32% to 42%.

>As my co-author G.R. Reddy will explain, the comparison is not between 32% and 42%; what was 39% became 42%, because of the way the computations differed. This increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and CSS. So there has been virtually no advantage for the States

>G.R. Reddy: The 14th FC considered the entire revenue account. Unlike the previous FCs, it considered even the Plan revenue account. As a result, some of the Plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolution.

>The difference between 14th FC and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 4-5% of the total devolution. If you take these two together, the actual devolution would have been 39% earlier and that became 42%. Even this 3% increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the Centre. The reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the States in CSS and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011; half way through, in 2015-16, it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schools.

>The entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure – both capital and operational expenditure, has now fallen on the States.

>They then restructured 66 CSS into 22 umbrella schemes. So there is no change in the number of CSS schemes. All components have remained the same.

Why didn’t States raise the issue?

>We have done so before the 15Th FC… and communicated to the Centre that what they had done was not correct.

>Immediately after the 14th FC recommendations were accepted, the Hon Prime Minister wrote to us saying ‘now that the States are flush with funds…’, We wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the States, but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers. Now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to States – we are getting more money through untied transfers.

>The total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the States from the Centre has remained at the same level – 49%.

Aren’t untied transfers desirable? It frees States to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fit…

>Whatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitment.

>In the revised pattern of CSS, you have to put in more money.

>You have made a commitment, you can’t ‘uncommit’. But they have changed the pattern. Whatever untied funds you have got, you put in those schemes.

>For example, in 2014, Telangana’s contribution to the CSS was around ₹2,000 crore. In 2015-16, because of the change in funding patterns, it has gone up to ₹3,500 crore. So there is additional commitment on the part of the States.

>There is further commitment for States, because of termination of some CSS – the model schools scheme is an example. Another is BRGF – backward regions grant fund - for Telangana State, 9 of the then 10 districts were under the BRGF. They substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare also.

>There is a view that there are just too many CSS – money is not efficiently used

>The other concern with CSS is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes. For example, if you take education or health, States are spending close to 80%. The Centre is supplementing the States up to only 20%, which does not make much difference. That too comes with conditionalities, submission of uses, visits of Central teams, delays in release of funds. As a result of these procedures, we are unable to fully utilise the Centre’s allocations. I don’t think any State has used the funds from Centre entirely.

So the solution is to offer funds and allow States a free hand?

>The Commission under Dr. Reddy recommended the same – that the number of CSS should be restricted to some nationally identified priorities.

>Dr. Y.V. Reddy: Basic issue is that Finance Commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula. 80-90% of transfers to States has always been on tax devolution. In tax devolution, there are no conditions, how much weight you give for population, which census’ population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity. The only question there is what weight you give. If you give weight equally for efficiency and equity, they cancel out, in some sense.

You mentioned institutional vacuum. Do you think NITI Aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?

>There were some deficiencies in the way the Planning Commission functioned. There was an impression given to the States that they had to go to the Commission as a supplicant but not for discussion. That was its weakness which had to be corrected. In the correction process, that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system. There is no forum now. Each Ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the States.

Is it deliberate that the Aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?

>That is a question mark. Whether it was by design or by default, the result is that the individual Ministries are indicating to the States, which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the States in the process.

There is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th FC may not stand the test of constitutional validity. What’s your view?

>There are 3-4 issues. It is true that it generated unprecedented reaction. Never before for an FC have a number of CMs got together and protested. Also, some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some Terms of Reference – for example, whether there is need for revenue deficit.

>The constitution provides for it and each FC needs to decide on this. Third, the 15th FC has been asked to review the 14th FC. It is a continuing process. Above all, the Commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that States should conform to certain policy parameters, which reflected the existing policy of the Centre.

>The way the FC is structured, it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central government’s priorities of the day. So it has been questioned on several grounds.

>Most of the considerations mentioned in the ToR are not necessarily binding on the FC. The Commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account. But it needs courage and vision for the Commission to do so – we are hoping that will be there.

What’s your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th FC?

>The whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not. It is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis. Because the FC is supposed to take into account the needs of the State for the period. How can 1971 population determine the needs of the State in 2021? It was undertaken on the grounds that States should not be penalised. But what about States that have taken action on family planning after 1971? They don’t get anything. It should be a continuing incentive, right?

>This time, they prescribed 2011 population. That is also not valid. The FC recommendations are from 2020. So you should have estimated population of the States for the period 2020-2025. Ideally, there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the FC but if at all, one should have the population relevant for the period.

Isn’t GST a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?

>It is an extraordinary institution and is commendable. It did not come into existence overnight. It started as an informal committee in the Finance Ministry and has evolved. In the implementation, there has been dissatisfaction expressed. The fact that the Centre has a veto increases its influence. But that is part of the game. Concerns may be there in the way it is working. But as an institutional set up, it is extraordinarily good. It is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the Union and the States.

Can this be replicated in other areas?

>Exactly. This is on the revenue side. On the expenditure side, fiscal transfers outside the FC, it can be brought under some inter-State council. That was the recommendation of the 14th FC.

>The GST Council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on. On the expenditure side, it is a different type of collaboration, compared to the revenue side.

Is that a recommendation that the 15th FC can give?

>Yes. The transfers to the States from the Centre can take FC and non-FC routes. The 14th FC gave recommendations on how to structure the non-FC transfers. It’s only in the ambit of advice.

>There are three approaches: virtually abolish the Commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage; the second is to have a continuous FC, a GST Council type of mechanism but the FC gets subsumed in this; the third is to have the FC and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical, more political and more consensus-based, as recommended by the 14th FC.

>All this is provoked partly because of the GST Council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum — both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanisms.

Pleasantly surprised at the functioning of the GST Council. It comprises people with varying vote bank compulsions.

>The consensus has been the result of number of years of effort. Consultative process has been going on for the last 10-15 years. States also are convinced that it is a win-win situation, for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country, they felt it was better. And there was also the feeling that GST is a better form of tax, leading to better compliance. It builds up a value chain. Initially, there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing States that they may lose out this being a destination tax. So we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years. The states have yielded lot more space than the Centre. For States, VAT constituted about 60% of their old tax revenue. They have conceded 50% of their fiscal space to the Centre, whereas the space conceded by the Centre is only 30%. They still get customs duty, income tax etc. In the working, there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the Centre, which has almost a veto power.

>Then, the way the GST is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the Centre. Like delays in apportionment of IGST, delays in payment of compensation cess, collecting more compensation cess than required. Best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing. So there is surplus compensation cess lying with the Centre to be distributed after 5 years. It is for the Centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficit.

On the special category status for Andhra Pradesh, what was the stand that you took in the 14th FC?

>Special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any FC. In my book, I have explained the Centre’s version of the relationship between 14th FC recommendation and the special category.

>If you want the simple truth, 14th FC did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category. The issue of according special category status and assurance by the PM was given months before the 14th FC could give recommendations.

>But the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th FC with regard to special category status. I have given that in the book. It is for the reader to decide why and how these are related.

Cess is becoming a monster in the administrative system. With GST we assumed that cess won’t any longer be a part of the system. But with Kerala, we have a disaster cess. Isn’t the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?

>There is a calamity fund and the Centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing, you can’t anticipate this. Now the recourse to cess for such things is unusual.

Isnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? The Council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that State...

>That is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism. These are ‘innovations’ that some States are uncomfortable with.

You have Kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and Uttarakhand at the lower end; T.N., Gujarat and Maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with Odisha and Bihar at the other. How is it possible for any central body, including the FC to reconcile these differences?

>That is exactly the issue with regard to any federation. In any federation there are competing considerations. You have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula. That’s how you operate the system.

>What is needed is for the Centre to be able to bring together the States and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both Union and States participate. Problem now is that whenever a State opposes the Centre it is accused of being anti-national. Being anti-union is not anti-national.

>There are 3 levels of debate – State interest, Union interest, national interest. To build a national consensus, the Union and States must be together. If the States get the feeling that the Union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest, the States resent it. That is the essence of the matter.

How much is this because of a strong leader at the top?

>You should go back to Constituent Assembly debates. Dr Ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution, discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for India. He says that India is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability. He says continuous accountability is more important than stability. That was the deliberate choice on this type of issue.

In 14th FC, you recommended forest cover as a determinant. In the five years that have lapsed, have you studied how that recommendation has helped India’s environment cause?

>No. But it’s an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation. But the logic is simple – forest cover. The state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself. It cannot use the resource but has to maintain it. So you have to provide for it. The basic principle is externalities. The state is contributing at its own cost – it does not gain anything. It incurs cost to maintain the forest.

[AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-70-marginal-tax-rate-isnt-that-radical)

When we were born as a republic and our Constitution was being drafted, one of the tallest leaders of the land could foresee the problem we ail with even today. BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.

We have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.

I am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers & sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'

While all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.

All these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!

I do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.

A rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.

So yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.

I am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.

Lastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love.

This is a matter of national shame. We are losing on our rights and India's continued potential to lead the knowledge and skills economy which relies on reliable internet access. We have now started reaching out to parliamentarians on this issue. 

This continues our working model of activism where our public engagement is toward institutional outcomes. A short recap. We have through the #KeepUsOnline campaign reached out to 15,000 individual and 80 institutional signatories who petitioned the government to condemn internet shutdowns. We then followed it up with a series of RTI's which demonstrate the legal rules for shutdowns were made secretly, and most recently supported a legal analysis of these rules by one of the domain experts in the area, Nakul Nayak. 

We will continue working against internet shutdowns, meeting people, talking to them about them and ensuring India has a better rank in 2019. Do follow our updates.

**So, what is IFF doing about it?**

Next stop is parliament and we are looking towards our legislators. The dates for the winter session have been announced which commences from December 11. We sensed there was a need to reach out to the offices of various legislators in advance. As subject area experts we are attempting to set up time, talk to their offices and explain this issue to them. Our hope through such knowledge sharing and to enable greater parliamentary engagement on Internet Shutdowns in India. To enable this, two volunteers (Arpitha and Hardik) authored a brief of this issue which is now being sent across along with meetings to put this issue across to several parliamentarians.

###Scumbag journalist: 

###Writes article saying ""Do the math"". Does no math.

**Faulty Basic Assumptions:**

A look at the JP¥ - IN₹ exchange rate over [the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/NcmqjkW) is fluctuating around ₹0.6 for JP¥1, for the most part. Here's a longer and more detailed view of the [last decade](https://imgur.com/tOxvgAM). While there are spikes and lows, the average seems to be sticking to around 0.6 Rupees per Yen. 

While Japan's Inflation Rate trend graph is certainly quite flat when averaged over the last decade or so, and the average remains near-zero, India's inflation rate has been trending downwards over the past decade, and has [accelerated downwards over the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/SoCXbPi).

The author seems to correlate the difference in inflation with the exchange rate, but the two are not actually linked directly. For instance, India's inflation rates for the years 2009 and 2010 were steep, at 14.97% and 9.47% respectively. During the same years, Japan's inflation rates were -1.67% and -0.40% respectively. The Yen actually *increased* in value, while the Rupee *dropped* in value, within their respective domestic markets. Yet the [exchange rate from January 2009 till January 2011 (the same 2 full years)](https://imgur.com/DHgubGX) remained relatively steady, somewhere between 0.485 - 0.550, on average, a range of about 0.065. One would expect to see a massive increase in the exchange rate, with one yen being able to buy *significantly more rupees*. But that was not the case. So the value of a currency on international markets has little to do with the domestically-perceived inflation in the country.

>Another factor to be considered is that while an interest rate of 0.1% may appear free from an Indian perspective, it is not so in Japan.

Has the author even considered that there are scenarios that are win-win? That economics is not a zero-sum game? This deal should be great for Japan. It can also be good for India. 

###So since the author was a lazy schmuck, here's the actual math:

We are currently getting Japan to invest USD 17 Billion in the project.

Since the author is concerned with exchange rates, that's JP¥ 1.89 trillion . Which is currently ₹ 1.09 trillion. 

^(Note: While writing this, I used figures like JP¥ 1.892 tr and ₹ 1.093 tr for my calculations, but rounded that last digit off while editing the text, in order to avoid visual confusion with the 4-digit years like 1967, 2067, etc. So the calculation is more precise than it looks.)

Over 50 years at 0.1% interest rates, the amount payable (at the end of 2067) would be JP¥ 1.99 trillion. If the current exchange rate were to remain constant, that would be ₹ 1.15 trillion. But assuming the *peak* exchange-rate in the last 10 years (ie: 0.71872 - July 2012), India would be repaying about ₹ 1.43 trillion. That's *STILL* an interest rate of less than 0.54%, assuming they had loaned us the entire amount in Rupees, instead of Yen.

So effectively, worst case scenario, **we got a loan of a trillion rupees, for 50 years, at a 0.5% interest rate.**

###Now here's where the author's argument (and lack of math) is turned on its' head:

Assuming 0% inflation in Japan, the value of that currency when repaid in Yen will be *equally* valuable in 50 years, as it would be if we paid all JP¥ 1.99 trillion upfront. So they aren't losing anything but time. That's great for them.

But seeing how India's inflation is assumed to be significantly above 0%, the value of the ₹ 1.43 trillion repayment amount in 2067 will actually be *lower*, as perceived within India. Remember, domestic inflation doesn't translate directly into exchange rates. So even if the Yen-Rupee exchange rate becomes horribly high, the domestic inflation would actually *cushion* the sum we would have to pay. 

###Still don't get it? Okay try this: 

Here's a real-life example using real data from the past:

* I used [this link for the calculation of exchange rate](http://fxtop.com/en/currency-converter-past.php?A=1093&C1=JPY&C2=INR&DD=01&MM=01&YYYY=1967&B=1&P=&I=1&btnOK=Go%21)
* I used [this link to calculate inflation](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Let's forget the 'trillions' for simplicity.

Say your Grandpa took a loan of JP¥ 1,892.00, 50 years ago (1967), at 0.1% interest rate, the value of it in Rupees was ₹ 39.42. Today you need to repay the loan as it has been 50 years. You need to pay back JP¥ 1,989.00. According the the present exchange-rate, that comes to ₹ 1,156.00.

Now, back in Grandpa's day, ₹ 1,156 was a lot of money. You could easily pay the rent for 2 months with just ₹ 100. In 1967, ₹ 100 was the average monthly salary in India. ₹ 1,156 would have been nearly **a full year's salary**, back then. Today, ₹ 1,156 is what you pay for 2 large pizzas. In 1967, a Coke was for ₹ 0.05, meaning you could buy 23,120 bottles of Coke with ₹ 1,156. Today, you can buy only 115 bottles of Coke with that amount (the original small glass bottles at that). India experienced a cumulative inflation of ~4000% over the last 50 years. Paying back ₹ 1,156 today, feels the equivalent of [paying back ₹ 30.25 back in 1967](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=30.25&C1=INR&INDICE=INCPI1958&DD1=18&MM1=09&YYYY1=1967&DD2=19&MM2=09&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Meanwhile in Japan, the value of JP¥ 1,989.00 today has only dropped to a third of its' 1967 value ([worth about JP¥ 620.00 of the time](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value)). Japan experienced relatively tiny cumulative inflation of 224% over 50 years.

So your Grandpa paid off a month's rent in 1967, and only had to buy the Japanese lender 2 pizzas 50 years later? And the Japanese lender actually lost money in the process? Huh. Guess that's why interest rates are higher in currencies that have higher inflation rates.

Now obviously, if the author is right, and Japan's inflation remains a flat 0% for the next 50 years, then Japan certainly won't lose any money on this deal. Which is excellent for them! However, it still means that India, with a non-negative inflation rate, will actually be coming out on top, as long as the currency exchange doesn't go absolutely berserk. 

###Assuming a 3% inflation rate, when we pay back ₹ 1.43 Trillion in 2067, it will be as if we were paying back only ₹ 0.326 Trillion (in today's terms). 

^(*assuming the peak conversion rate of the past 10 years: JP¥ - IN₹ 0.71872, which is a worst-case scenario*)

This is because ₹ 1.4 trillion will have far less perceived value (domestically) in 2067, than it does in 2017. 

Put another way, if we take ₹ 326 Billion today, and invest it in a *reaaaalllyyy* shitty-ass mutual fund that only yields 3% interest (that's impossibly pathetic, seriously), then in 50 years, it will easily pay off our 'loan' of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

If you're using a Fixed Deposit scheme that gives 7% interest per annum, **you will only need to invest ₹ 49 Billion.** [Try it for yourself here](http://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php)

So... take this loan of ₹ 1.09 trillion, and put ₹ 49 Billion aside in the 7% fixed deposit account, and use the balance ₹ 1.04 trillion as you see fit... hire strippers, or invest in solar power plants, or build a railway with it. What do you call 1.04 trillion bucks that you can do with as you see fit without needing to pay it back? You call it free money. Obviously, the more wisely you invest it, the better the outcomes will be. But yes, it's effectively free. 

Now, mind you, we aren't getting it as cash, but we *are* getting it as a solid investment that will generate revenue (and pay off its' own dues) and will have further positive externalities (employment, new skills and training, tech-transfer, economic growth of connected areas, increased urbanization, reduced environmental impact, reduced accidents, lower congestion, etc). It will also leave a lot of the money in government coffers available for more investment into other projects over the next few decades, many of which should see some decent returns on investment over the next 5 decades.

Yes, Japan comes out a winner in the deal, ***and so does India!*** The higher our domestic inflation, the cheaper our repayment will seem. Just like Grandpa's ₹ 1156 seems like such a paltry amount, when seen from 50 years later. Obviously we don't want the inflation to be too high, but having a sub-4% inflation rate will keep our economy healthy, while reducing the burden on future taxpayers in paying off this big 'loan'.

This, btw, is the reason you should invest your money and ensure that it gives returns of **at least** 5-7% per annum, in order to beat inflation. Because otherwise, sitting in a bank account, your money is actually **losing** value over time.

>The 508km-long Mumbai to Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR) is scheduled for completion in December 2023, but commencement date has been sought to be advanced to August 2022.

>Initially, each high speed train will have 10 cars and the capacity to accommodate 750 people, The Times of India said. It will increase to 16 cars that will accommodate 1,200 people.

>According to initial estimates, around 1.6 crore people are expected to travel by the bullet train annually. By 2050, around 1.6 lakh commuters should travel by the high-speed train on a daily basis.

> The fares could be in the range of Rs 3000 - Rs 5,000.

^(Source - http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mostly-elevated-partly-under-sea-all-you-need-to-know-about-mumbai-ahmedabad-bullet-train/story-nzG4ROjD9IRE00FcK4fD7N.html)

They want to complete it in 5-6 years, but let's be conservative and just give it 10 years. Let's assume that the next 10 years has all the construction and the low-volume trains running and then just directly jump to the 1200 capacity trains by 2027, for ease of math. That leaves us 40 years to repay ₹ 1.43 trillion, using only train revenues.

The article claims that 1.6 crore people may travel annually initially (that's 44,000 people per day), but that it'll increase to 1,60,000 people per day by 2050. Basically, they intend to increase capacity to 360% over 40 years. Since capacity isn't something that can increase exponentially, we'll assume a linear growth in capacity, from 44k to 160k. The train completes a single trip in 2.5 hours. Assume 30 minute boarding/de-boarding time on either end, a single train will conservatively make 1 full trip in 3.5 hours. That means that a single train can comfortably make 4 trips in a day (14 hours active duty) leaving 10 hours for maintenance and all that jazz. Meaning one train has the capacity to ferry 4800 people per day.


    160000-44000 = 116000 people: increased capacity over 40 years
    116000/4800 = 24 trains: added capacity over 40 years
    (40*12)/24 = 20 months: the time it takes to add one more train to the system.

Basically: One new 1200-seater train is added every 20 months, for 40 years, after a starter-pack of 9 trains (for the initial load of 44k people per day).

So averaged over 40 years, there are around 12+9 trains operating. That gives us 21 trains, making 4 trips a day. (Side note: 21*4: That's 84 trips per day, both ways, meaning that assuming 14 working-hours on a platform, there are 3 trains departing every hour in one direction - one every 20 minutes - convenient). Each trip has a capacity of 1200 people, 365 days a year, for 40 years. 

    21*4*1200*365*40 = 1471680000 passengers total.

1,471,680,000 passengers total: that's **1.47 Billion passengers**. And how much is being charged per seat per trip? ₹ 3000? 

###That gives us a total revenue collection of ₹ 4.415 Trillion. 

Let's assume that the train only runs at 70% seating capacity, on average. They would still collect ₹ 3.09 Trillion. 

[Operational costs will be around ₹ 412 cr (₹ 4.12 billion) per year](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Yearly-bullet-train-operations-to-cost-Rs-412cr-Report/articleshow/39191311.cms) which comes to a total of ₹ 164.8 billion over 40 years. 

That leaves us with ₹ 2.93 Trillion in revenue, with which we need to repay a total loan value of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

**That leaves a cool ₹ 1.496 trillion as pure profit, after paying back every penny of the loan.**

###Wait, what?! 

*You're telling me, we can basically drop the ticket prices to ₹ 1500 per seat (an act that will almost surely yield packed trains every day) and* **still** *pay off the loan?!* 

I dunno! Let's check: 

* 1.471 billion trips * ₹ 1500 = ₹ 2.2075 Trillion. 
* *STILL* assume just 75% occupancy: ₹ 1.656 Trillion.
* Deducting the operational costs leaves: ₹ 1.491 Trillion. 

Hot *damn*, we can pay for the train using just ticket collection, even if we price the tickets at ₹ 1500, and using the most conservative estimates possible. With ₹ 1.656 Trillion revenue, we easily could allow for an increase in ""operational costs"" to ₹ 5.675 billion per year (a whopping **38% increase** in operational costs, compared to the ₹ 4.12 billion figure) and still be able to pay everything off just fine... in just 40 years.

Who in their right minds thinks this is a bad idea? Hell, Ahmadabad-Mumbai Sleeper buses take 8 hours, and charge between ₹ 700-1400. The Shinkansen will be absolutely *flooded* if they drop prices.

###DO THE MATH",False,Policy/Economy
547,6z7u08,"Understanding the Petro Dollar, its possible decline, Fiat Currencies and how it all affects India and Why maybe it's time to look elsewhere to hold foreign reserves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6z7u08/understanding_the_petro_dollar_its_possible/,52,45,concernadian,"The whole thing came up recently during some discussions I had about why people use the dollar for international trade and what would happen if the major economies of the world just stopped using the Dollar. What is the Impact of BRICS. Why US has so many wars in the middle east and they are supposedly for oil but they never really take over any oil. How US is so rich to have 800 military bases around the world with a defence budget larger than the rest of the world combined. About why countries still hold US dollar reserves when US is in trillions of dollars of debt and being in so much debt, how is US economy still afloat? So I thought of putting it together here for myself and anyone else who may want to learn about this. Now, this is what I have gleaned from my reading on the matter. I am no economist so if anyone wants to correct me on anything, I would be welcome to accept the criticism with reference material substantiating your point.

 in 1944, all the countries entered into the Bretton Woods Agreement which basically said that all of the world’s currrecies would be backed by the US Dollar and the US dollar would be backed by gold and any country could convert their currency into US dollars and then redeem US gold in exchange for that at the rate of 35 dollars per ounce of gold. Since US had the largest gold reserves at the time (75% of the entire world's gold), everyone agreed. This also allowed US treasury to fix exchange rates of dollar into different currencies and set the interest rates for interbanking transactions etc. However, the multiple wars of the US during the ’60s caused domestic inflation in the US and the value of Dollar to fall. This caused panic in all the countries and they started redeeming gold from US treasury. The US gold fell from 20,000 tonnes to 8100 tonnes very quickly. Thus, in 1971, Nixon closed the gold window i.e. he suspended the ability of any nation to redeem US gold against dollars and took the gold backing off of the US Dollar. While that allowed US to retain its gold reserves, it made the need of the US dollar among other countries non existent. So everyone started to move away from the Dollar. After that, US economy started to spiral and the price of gold became 135 dollars per ounce. On top of that, the Arab world hiked the oil prices. Now, the US desperately needed to stabilize the spiral. So they brokered a deal with the Saudis that the oil producers would not only trade oil in nothing but US Dollars and convince the OPEC (the middle eastern, north African and other oil producing countries) to do the same but also invest their (OPEC’s) oil profits in US treasury by buying US Treasury bonds. This basically means that they (OPEC) are buying out US debt. Not only this, US is printing Dollars against the amount of Foreign investments in the US treasury which is made by Oil producing nations which are their oil profits. So basically, profits from every barrel sold by OPEC make way to the US treasury and become the value against which dollars is printed. Ultimately, more the profits in oil, stronger the dollar and lesser the profits in oil, weaker the dollar. Thus US gets a double benefit out of every barrel of oil in a way. In exchange the US would sell them (Saudis) advance weapons and all the gold they demanded. (So basically weapons and gold sale in exchange for trading oil in dollars props up US dollar. Gold is still propping up US dollar indirectly by forcing the oil producers to trade in dollars). Thus the petrodollar was born. This caused the world to need US dollar again. If you wanted to buy oil, you needed US dollar by either converting your currency or by selling stuff to the US. The latter is more preferred as it is cheaper than exchanging your currency and also grows your economy. So once again, US became the benchmark of international trade since no country can hope to grow its economy without using energy aka oil and you can’t have oil without US dollars. As long as all these countries need oil, US can just print Dollars out of thin air and balance it against oil barrels (as explained above) without actually even owning a single drop of oil. (Other countries need to own the gold that they balance their currency against). US does not need to control oil, they just need to control the currency it is traded in to keep their economy afloat. (more on that later in US foreign policy). Similarly, US bokered a deal with the Latin American countries to not only trade in the US Dollar but also to give precedence to US, EU and Japanese products in trade. So if more and more countries decide to shun the dollar and trade in other currencies, this would eventually cause OPEC to switch as well and Dollar could collapse.

How? Well, US is basically just printing enormous amounts of money out of thin air. This money is being used domestically and to a much larger extent, globally. If international oil trade in dollar stops, people stop needing the dollar and use their own currency. So all the internationally circulating dollars would come back to US. Now that is just too many dollars against very little amount in the treasury and that would cause hyperinflation and economic spiral. However, the logical next step would be to just destroy the excess dollars coming in from abroad and that would keep the country’s economy afloat. While that is okay but remember, what is the dollar being printed against? The foreign investments in the treasury which are the profits from the oil trade in dollars. That would go away as well essentially leaving nothing in the treasury against which the dollar is valued. Hence dollar will literally not be worth the money it is printed on.

Second, since US currency is basically a petrodollar, its power depends on the control of oil. So right now, whoever controls middle east has major power. Today, Saudi Arabia controls Middle East and US controls Saudi Arabia. US-Saudi brotherhood sort of makes it impossible for other countries to have an influence over this. Russia has tried for decades to establish a strong foothold in the middle east but has been unsuccessful. It has also dictated the US foreign policy far the last 5 decades. Like I said, US needs to control not the oil reserves but the currency oil is traded in. Hence all the wars we hear that were for oil, were not actually for oil per se but intimidation tactics against countries that announced that they would no longer accept dollar as a currency in international oil trade. Egs When the Ayatollah of Iran announced their intention to denounce dollars in oil trade and use their own currency instead, US backed Iraq to go to war with Iran and even provided the Weapons of mass destruction to use on Iran that they later used as an excuse to invade Iraq and prosecuted Saddam Hussein for. When Iraq invaded Kuwait ( a major producer of oil) to be able to pay their loans to Kuwait and then later asked for Euro to be used for oil trade rather than Petrodollar, US invaded Iraq. When Gaddafi asked gold based Dinar instead of US dollars for oil trade, US invaded Libya. When Chavez did the same, Us staged a coup in Venezuela. However, starting a non-petro currency would break this link and oil and Middle east would become less relevant for Economic power and only be of interest for energy concerns. It is still important but less so than a economic and geopolitical chessboard of US that it is today. It may actually be a solution to achieving peace in the middle east.

However, another thing that happens is Middle East controls prices of oil which is tied to the Dollar. Recently, the Middle East (OPEC or basically Saudi Arabia) has decided to drop the international prices for their own economic reasons. Now, the countries that have oil production as a major source of revenue and trade in dollars eg many N African countries, Venezuela have seen their economy completely stabilise and destroyed. These countries are sick of US and Saudi controlling the markets in a way that affects other countries adversely. Hence, for these countries, switching to the international trading system of a gold based currency will cause their economies to stabilise.

The international reserves of EU etc, on the other hand have seen increased holdings by the OPEC countries and have been worried of increasing power of these countries in the international banking system. They would be only to glad to get rid of these holdings.

Now, non Dollar currency would cause a fall in the US dollar value. In lieu of that, here is another thing that needs to be considered. A lot of the developing countries have international trade deficits. Now these trade deficits can be in the currency of the country to whom the debt is owed or any other internationally accepted currency eg. the Dollar. If the debt is in dollars, the conversions and interest rates of borrowing are determined according to the rules of the US treasury. Again, the rates in the US treasury are linked to the value of dollar. Most countries giving out loans prefer to do so in dollars as historically the Dollar is strong and trusted not to collapse and hence the money they owe is safe. The countries taking loans also convert their debts to dollars as it is easier and the country to whom the debt is owed cannot just up and change the value of the debt owed by manipulating their currency as dollar has determined the conversion into other currencies at fixed rates, so it is safe for everyone. However, there is a slight problem with this. If you owe a debt of 1 dollar to someone, when you pay the debt, it will depend on the value of dollar to your currency at that particular instant. So if dollar has gotten stronger wrt to your currency, you shall have to pay more money and if the dollar has gotten weaker, you will owe less money in your currency. Hence the fall of the dollar would be beneficial for the countries who owe debt in dollars and bad for the countries who have loaned out debt in dollars.

Also, taking debt in dollars becomes cheaper if the value of dollar falls since the US treasury interest rates are directly tied to dollars, hence it becomes cheaper to borrow in dollars. Also, as I said, if it grows weaker still, yo will owe less money.

One more thing to consider regarding fall of the Dollar is this. Uptil now, the oil producers have been buying US treasury bonds due to the Bretton Woods deal. Other countries and US and other corporations do so too. Now, the US treasury gives a fixed rate of interest to those investing in the treasury. This rate, in turn is linked to the value of the dollar. Stronger the dollar, more the interest on US Treasury bonds and more the foreign countries invest in it. Now this means that these foreign countries would much rather invest their money in US Treasury at an assured fixed rate of interest than invest it in 3rd world countries and take a risk of maybe losing it. However, if the value of dollar were to fall, the countries would much rather draw out of the US treasury and invest more in the startups in different countries, domestically etc.

The other side of the same coin would be the countries dependent on US investment. Should the value of the dollar fall, the investment being received from the US would be of a lesser value.

On the other hand, there is one more thinh. Like I said, investments in dollars are governed by the US treasury rules. Now, basically, US banks have cut the taxes on money transfer and conversion, artificially keeping them very low to fuel the domestic and world trade etc . If the dollar were to collapse, people wouldn’t trade in dollars. They would trade in other currencies. The inetrbanking across the world would be then governed by the rules of the currency you trade in, for eg, BRICS nations will follow the tariffs etc of the Shanghai Bank where most of the reserves are held. So that effect would then depend on the rules of the bank you deal with and that can be detrimental or beneficial depending on the bank’s policies compared to the dollar.

Also, countries having holdings in the US treasury would lose the entire value of their foreign reserves. On the other hand coountries like BRICS who have their reserves in other international banks would retain the value of their foreign reserves in those banks.

What does this mean?

Indian Currency would also fall with the fall of the dollar in its current state. Now, we usually run around with the perception that Indian currency is backed by gold, That’s not true. The truth is 99% of today’s currencies US Dollar, Euro, Indian rupee, all of them are fiat currencies i.e. their value is not determined by the gold they hold but by the economic strength of the government. Only an average of 4–7% of any country’s currency is today, backed by gold. US Dollar - 4.5%, Indian rupee - 5%. The rest is held in the terms of foreign reserves in other countries like in the form of US Dollar (around 70%) in US treasury bonds, in world bank or IMF, in other currencies (around 25%) in BRICS and other foreign reserves etc. Currently if you have rs 1000 , only rs 50 is gold, around 670 is held in the form of US dollars and Rs 280 in other currencies. You might ask why is that? Well, remember the Bretton Woods agreement. At that time US had 75% of the world’s gold which backed dollar and dollar backed other currencies so most of the currency of any country was backed directly or indirectly through dollar by gold. Now, it is difficult to keep gold in your country so it was convenient for other countries to just hold foreign reserves in dollars especially with the fixed exchange rates they provided. Hence more and more portion of their currency was being held in dollars. However, after Nixon shock of 1971, dollar removed its gold backing. So, automatically all other currencies that were backed by dollar (99% of the world currencies) also became fiat currencies as a result. However, the dollar was still good and trusted so no one thought much of it, especially since dollars were being printed out of thin air. However, now with the prospect of the trust in dollar fading, this as started to worry some experts. Because of the senseless printing of dollars and in exchange all the fiat currencies, the total amount of currency can nowhere near be compensated by the gold reserves even if all the gold in the world was put together. It would form not more than 10% of the currency in the world. Now, putting this disturbing detail aside, if Dollar were to collapse, 670 rupees of your 1000 would become worthless, too. So, it isn’t wise to hold US dollars, is it? No its, not and many countries have woken up to that fact.

China has been secretly amassing large amounts of gold. OPEC countries have started removing their capital from US treasury. See, these oil producers have been receiving US gold in exchange for trading oil in US dollars and have accumulated holdings in other countries’ treasuries. Now with all the crazy gold they have received they have bought material assets like real estate etc even in other countries. Now, they can simply sell out their US treasury bonds and buy more assets such as gold and real estate from it, which they have been doing in the recent years. Now, this will start depleting the treasury and cause the fall in the value of the dollar in turn causing other countries to withdraw and invest elsewhere. That, coupled with Russia and China doing trade in Roubles and Yuan, India and Iraq trading oil outside of dollar, Germany and China trading outside of Dollar, the strenghtening of BRICS bank etc, Dollar has been showing a steady decline. So India should also wisen up and start replenishing its treasury with gold and sell off holdings in dollars and euros and invest in other currencies on the rise. This is one reason BRICS could be very important for India and other countries in BRICS whether we like it or not. 

Another thing that using another currency would do, it would take away the power of the US to slap economic sanctions on whichever country they choose. This is one of the major reasons Putin has teamed up with China - in order to bypass US sanctions.

*[Edit: The thing that worries most nations is this - having international trade and foreign reserves in dollars gives US a single handed say on their economies. Just like Nixon's unilateral decision changed the fate of all currencies, other decisions by it can also change their economies. US can dictate their rules and if you don't follow them - sanctions. So the countries want to take back the power of making decisions in their own hands.*

*Next, the petrodollar is based on a commodity that is being depleted. Oil reserves are declining and the world is moving towards other sources - gree energy, nuclear energy etc. So the petrodollar decline is destined. However, what would US do next? They could shift to backing their currency with nuclear reserves or some new crazy idea out of someone's hat. That will, inevitably affect all other countries and they want to and should have a say in it.]*

On the other hand, China's attempt to start a gold backed currency may not pan out because like I said all the gold in the world is not sufficient to back all the currencies in the world. Also, since most currencies still have a large amount of dollar backing, fall of the dollar would make that percent of the currency valueless and therefore even having a reserve in another foreign currency could still cause a fall in Indian currency though it might be a little mitigated. On the other hand, fiat currencies are run by the investors' trust in the currency. So even if the dollar falls, a fiat currency with foreign reserves in the dollar may not fall because the confidence in that currency is still high. Sadly, such a currency would be Chinese Yuan. So, the policy to fix this? I am still trying to work on that solution. This is a post in evolution. My thoughts on this are still in evolution and I would really like some economists to come and hold a serious, well informed and sane discussion on this.

 I will add more when other points occur to me or are brought forward to me in any online or offline discussions.

WARNING - Long wall of text

------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHO IS BULLYING BHUTAN?

On 26th June 2017, The Times of India posted a video on YouTube claiming to show Chinese and Indian troops jostling and shoving each other on what The Times commentator said is “Indian land” on the “Indian side” of the Sikkim border. He accused China of “aggression” and the Chinese troops of being “extremely aggressive.”

A few days later, it emerged that the dispute had nothing to do with Indian land. The China-India confrontation was taking place on the China-Bhutan border. Yet Chinese and Indian media quickly roused patriotic fervour and railed against each other.

Chinese media said India would be “kicked out”, “taught a bitter lesson” and “suffer greater losses than in 1962. One Chinese editorial mocked India’s claim to be defending Bhutan and accused India of treating Bhutan as a “vassal state” and forcing it to support India.

Meanwhile an Indian headline read: “China: The World’s Bully”, and another article called China “a geopolitical bully….The mere fact that a vastly bigger country like China is indulging in such antics against a peaceful neighbour like Bhutan shows the extent to which Beijing will stoop to, to occupy territory illegally, slicing it off like a salami, just like it's done with India.”

Through such welter of mutual recriminations and accusations, Bhutan’s media remained remarkably quiet and reserved, with “no aggressive posturing”, as reported by the Hindustan Times. And why should there be? The vast majority of Bhutanese have no interest in the remote, barren, high altitude Doklam Plateau, and have not even heard of it.

But the 89 sq.km. parcel does have strategic importance to India that sees Chinese presence there as a “dagger” pointed at its narrow and vulnerable 21-km wide “chicken’s neck” that links it to its northeastern states. And so, Bhutan’s initial quiet restraint was not good enough for India, and Bhutan quickly fell into line.
On 3rd July FirstPost headlines read: “Bhutan vents out first major disclaimer against Chinese, sides with India…” The article went on to say: “Bhutan, for the first time has taken a major stand against China's incursions …. Bhutan's stand against Beijing… goes on to show the country's unwavering alliance and support for big brother India.”
And that characterization itself raises a big question: Who precisely is bullying Bhutan? And what exactly are Indian troops doing on Bhutanese land in the first place? Just defending poor little Bhutan against big China’s bullying “aggression”? Who, in fact, is more seriously threatening Bhutan’s sovereignty and independence – China or India?

When “friendship” turns to control.

In fact, India has maintained a strong military presence throughout Bhutan for half a century, exercising its power and influence in every corner of Bhutanese life. Even in the remote and strategic areas of northern Bhutan, far from anything Indian, Indian soldiers exercise their authority and control the movement of local Bhutanese. Convoys of Indian military trucks travel freely across Bhutan and cannot be checked for contents by the Bhutanese authorities. The Indian army has occupied the Haa Dzong for decades, and has given no indication of handing it back to the Bhutanese. The Dzongs have since the time of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel, the founder of Bhutan, been a seat of power and a symbol of governance.
It is noteworthy that Indian troops’ efforts to block Chinese road construction on the Bhutan border are portrayed in Indian media as stopping China from building roads into India – revealing just how little respect the Indians really have for Bhutanese “sovereignty.” But such spin is not surprising. In Bhutan, the IMTRAT (Indian Military Training) General, and Indian Ambassador both residing in the two most prized real estates in the capital, are said to be the most powerful men in the country, even determining what does and does not get published in the national media.

When Bhutan obtained Asian Development Bank funding for a strategic highway linking its east and west, to avoid the necessity of Bhutanese travel through troubled, strike-prone and often violent Assam and West Bengal, India vetoed the plan. The highway was cancelled and Bhutan remains dependent on India’s grace and mercy for its own internal east-west transit. Just a few weeks ago an angry mob of Indians beat up a Bhutanese truck driver and set his truck on fire for being involved in a road accident.
But this Indian interference and infringement on Bhutanese sovereignty extends far beyond the military-strategic sphere into every aspect of Bhutan’s political and economic life.

Thus, Bhutan is the only sovereign independent nation in the world that has no diplomatic relations with any of the five permanent U.N. Security Council members – the US, UK, France, China and Russia – only because India, jealous of its exclusive hegemony over Bhutan and fearful of any competitive influence, won’t allow it.
Japan has long been a friend of Bhutan, helping fund many developmental projects in Bhutan. The Japanese wished to have an embassy in Bhutan, to foster closer ties and more development projects. However, firm plans and agreement to build a Japanese Embassy in Thimphu were abruptly cancelled, once again due to India’s disapproval.

When China invited Bhutan to exhibit at its Shanghai EXPO in 2010, offering a free pavilion that would be a central installation in the EXPO, India forbade Bhutanese participation. Independent sovereign nations from the world over took part in the EXPO sans Bhutan. India, even if they forbade Bhutan, went and participated in the EXPO, even building a pavilion of their own. India regularly nixes Bhutanese official and commercial missions and visits to China, though it conducts its own with impunity, apparently due to Indian disapproval of potential competition with its own overweening influence.

More ominously, India has blatantly interfered in Bhutan’s elections and political processes. India strongly objected to Bhutan’s former Prime Minister forging extensive new diplomatic ties and carving out an independent foreign policy, and was furious when the Prime Minister simply met and talked with China’s Premier at the Rio + 20 conference. And so, India decided to get rid of him.
Just days before the 2013 elections, India removed its subsidies on liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene, thereby doubling and tripling prices on these essential commodities, to signal its disapproval of the existing government. The cynical tactic worked, and a new government far more compliant and obedient to India’s will and interests was elected.

Hydropower – cooperation or colonization?
But the cornerstone of India-Bhutan “cooperation” for three decades has been the hydropower that is a cheap power boon to India’s growing economy, and which accounts for fully 40% of Bhutan’s revenues and 25% of its GDP. Indian financing, which has switched from 70% grant and 30% loan to 30% grant and 70% loan at higher interest rates, is also the direct cause of Bhutan’s escalating debt that has even further deepened Bhutanese dependence on India.

Since, July 2006, when Bhutan and India agreed to develop 10,000 MW of hydropower from ten large projects, the benign sheen of this apparent cooperation has quickly faded as commissioned projects were delayed and costs mushroomed. Costs jumped $US 240 million at Mangdechhu; they doubled at Punatsangchhu–II, and they tripled at Punatsangchhu–I (from $US 500 million to $1.5 billion), and no end in sight.
And those costs obviously don’t include massive environmental damages for which future generations of Bhutanese will pay. A recent report from India documented severe impacts on water bodies and resources, forest and wildlife loss, and heavy pollution. The same report, reinforced by Bhutan’s own government statistics, notes that hydropower has failed to develop local capacity and employment, with most contracts going to Indian companies.
According to the IMF, Bhutan’s government debt now stands at a whopping 118% of GDP up from just 67% six years ago, with India by far the largest creditor, accounting for 64% of Bhutan’s total debt. By comparison, India’s ratio of government debt to GDP is 70% and China’s is 46%. Why does that ratio matter? Because it’s used by investors to measure a country’s ability to make future payments on its debt, thus affecting the country borrowing costs. Higher borrowing costs worsen debt further.

A recent British report on global debt lists Bhutan as one “among 14 other countries that are fast heading towards a debt crisis.” The report details hydropower’s rapid loss of economic viability, and concludes: “Should the hydropower sector’s financial performance continue to deteriorate, Bhutan’s solvency could be threatened.”
How convenient will that be for India? And what conditions will it attach to bailouts and pleas for loan forgiveness?
In this day and age, sovereignty and independence are much more likely undermined by economic than political control, albeit in far more subtle and hidden ways. So, the definition of “bullying” these days must go far beyond the old-fashioned geopolitical border disputes, however minor and insignificant, that still make for good press in TV images of jostling Chinese and Indian soldiers.

Time to ask hard questions – that can’t be publicly asked in Bhutan!

It’s time, if not long overdue, to question how benign India’s intentions are in Bhutan. How much “cooperation” is actually “exploitation” and “domination? And, how much of India’s foreign aid to Bhutan (now nearly $US1 billion a year) actually signifies mounting control and interference on one side and growing dependence and erosion of sovereignty on the other?

But of course, with Indian control of Bhutanese expression and politics, those questions will never be asked in Bhutan’s supposed free “democracy”. Just imagine if Bhutan’s daily Kuensel newspaper or its state-run Bhutan Broadcasting Service radio and television dared to publish this article. Unimaginable! How ironic that India, the world’s largest democracy that prides itself on its own free speech, utterly suppresses it in its “friendly neighbour”.
And here’s another question equally impossible to ask: How might it benefit Bhutan to warm up a bit more to China, and even to establish diplomatic relations with its huge northern neighbour, cooperate economically, and welcome selective Chinese aid and investments in Bhutan’s infrastructure?
After all, our connection with China already goes far beyond the political and economic to a deep cultural and spiritual affinity. For example, Bhutan shares directly with China the profound wisdom, texts and traditions of Mahayana Buddhism. China today is experiencing an unprecedented Buddhist revival that creates a natural and intuitive bond with Bhutan.

In fact, Bhutan is already benefitting directly from the resurgence of Buddhism in China. From one end of Bhutan to the other, from the giant Shakyamuni Buddha statue at Kuensel Phodrang in Thimphu to the giant Guru Rinpoche statue at Takila in Lhuentse, monasteries, temples, ceremonies and rituals are maintained, sponsored and supported through Chinese donations and contributions.

For all the fawning gratitude, praise, and adulation Bhutanese officials regularly heap on India for its “special relations” with Bhutan, what word of acknowledgement or appreciation do these officials ever utter for the steady, quiet Chinese support for our precious Bhutanese culture and traditions? Support, incidentally, that comes with “no strings attached” and no crippling debt burden!!

And this shared culture and tradition is a major reason for the surge in Chinese tourists flocking to Bhutan, now greatly outnumbering tourists from any other country. And while the Chinese all pay top dollar on expensive tourist visas to visit Bhutan, thus making China by far the largest contributor to Bhutan’s tourism industry, Indian visitors come for free, requiring no visa of any kind. Sorry to say this, but ask any hotel owner in the country who their least favourite, least respectful and most troublesome guests are, and they unfailingly say “Indians”.

The Prime Minister of Bhutan has agreed with India and promised to sign the South Asian Motor Vehicles Agreement (MVA). This would open up Bhutan to cars from India, Nepal and Bangladesh; further strengthening India’s hold on Bhutan. Just imagine Bhutan’s roads filled with Indian cars, taxis, buses and trucks. Indian tourists would come in busloads, totally over running Bhutan’s carefully planned ‘quality of quantity’ tourism policy that has helped protect Bhutan. Indian presence would increase, Bhutan’s roads would be destroyed by the increased traffic, resulting in more DANTAK presence to come ‘repair and maintain’ the roads, our pristine environment would be destroyed. It is interesting to note that the Prime Minister of Bhutan has agreed to sign this agreement, even if the National Assembly of Bhutan has voted against it. Showing how he is willing to do whatever the Indians want.
And despite the absence of diplomatic relations, Bhutan’s commercial relations with China are already quietly flourishing beneath the surface – all the way from yak-herders on Bhutan’s northern borders to Thimphu merchants dependent on Chinese imports, whose quality often far exceeds comparable Indian products.

In short, might Bhutan benefit in more ways than one by slipping away from total domination by one of its neighbours and instead strategically playing off and leveraging China-India competition to its own advantage?
But questions (let alone policies and solutions) like these are an unwritten “no go zone” in Bhutanese politics and media. Indeed, it is a telling mark of the sinister extent and penetration of Indian control and subjugation of Bhutan that no politician or journalist dare touch such questions with a ten-foot pole.

Interestingly, India is unwittingly aided in such suppression of free speech and other human rights by the utter failure of western human rights groups even to notice. Rather the west seems intent on drawing attention to human rights violations in countries like China, which has grown so rapidly into an economic powerhouse that its global reach now threatens western interests. Conveniently for India, it poses no such threat and escapes western scrutiny.

Yes, China may occasionally though very rarely “flex its muscles” in minor border disputes, as India accuses. But compared to Bhutan’s actual ground-level experience and interaction with China, isn’t India’s domination and subjugation of Bhutan far more intrusive, pervasive and insidious, extending into every portion of Bhutan’s social, political and economic fabric?

551,69jpql,ACCOUNTABILITY: This is what is wrong with Indian bureaucracy and our Brown Lords.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/69jpql/accountability_this_is_what_is_wrong_with_indian/,86,29,therollingindian,"If you are an Indian, it would be an astronomically impossible odd that you didn’t hear of how corrupt our bureaucracy is or how some **‘babu‘** or some **‘bade sahab‘** is corrupt and nothing more than a public disgrace. **That’s Indian bureaucracy for you.**

The real problem with bureaucrats is not just about caste and reservation. It is about accountability and responsibility. The pay structure of our Bureaucracy is such that officers get little salaries and large perks and amenities in form of bungalows and servants. In many cases, they occupy the same bungalows that the British left in 1947. And they do not do their job responsibly.

Fair disclosure that *I do understand and acknowledge the fact not all bureaucrats are corrupt. In fact, we have exemplary civil servants that have served as an inspiration to us all.* But this post is not about them, those honest civil servants. This is about what is wrong with Indian bureaucracy. The problem is not about the political issue or power struggles, but about an entire class of bureaucrats who are egoistic, arrogant, inhumane, corrupt and muddled with skulduggery.

**Bureaucrats, Bureaucracy, and Bureaucratic Measures** are now modern day derogatory overtones that express tyranny, arrogance and debilitation in our country’s governance. Bureaucrats are, in this day and age, perceived as those with massive egos and false nationalist zealotry. They are in essence a rule-bound bookkeepers who have ‘I’ mentality when it comes to interpreting rules. They play favorites, they are biased, they stay vague so that they are not held accountable, and they maintain chaos so that no one can see them cheat.

**From Outside: Looking In**

Don’t take my word for it. *I am just an ordinary Indian citizen exercising my freedom of speech.* Wouldn’t it help if you could see our Indian bureaucracy from an outside view? It is said that an unbiased opinion comes from the uninvolved. So let’s do that. Let’s see what others think of Indian bureaucracy.

In October 2010, just after the conclusion of Commonwealth Games in India, Eric Ellis wrote a post titled ‘A most uncivil service‘ on The Age where he talks about the Indian bureaucracy. Unfortunately, he has nothing good to say. He writes the following –

>""The Delhi games showed the world just what can be done when it's daunting civil service takes control – and the result wasn’t pretty. Corruption, waste, inefficiency, obfuscation and a cancerous lack of accountability in officialdom – and all of it on an Olympian scale.

>Delhi’s dramas may have been revealing for observers who briefly touch India but sadly these are the common issues daily confronting and long bedeviling a billion Indians and the foreign investors urged to invest their money in business there. Some economists have calculated that India’s bureaucratic inefficiency costs the country 1 to 2 points in annual growth.

>India’s daunting civil service is supposed to be the pride of the nation – just ask its privileged nabobs – but instead its malfunction and misgovernance hold India back. Enter any average government office in India and one is struck by the mountains of yellowing paperwork, years of filing and unfinished work ground down by the sheer scale of chaotic India’s myriad issues that overwhelm.""


Another account by Lant Pritchett of Harvard University sheds some brighter light on the Indian bureaucratic problem. In a paper, in 2009, titled “Is India a Failing State?“, he described Indian bureaucracy to be one of the most serious problems in the world today; up there with AIDS and climate change. He makes a point that foreign investments, and any welfare schemes in India for that matter, will never improve India’s economy as long as there is an inefficient Indian bureaucracy. These bureaucrats are like a tumorous growth that eat away any welfare funds like a parasite.

In his book “The Foundation Pillars for Change: Our Nation, Our Democracy & Our Future”, **Mr. V.K. Patel** writes that *most developmental spending fails to reach its intended recipients. It is either diverted or misused by a sizeable and a complacent bureaucracy.* I corroborate to Mr. Patel’s description of bureaucracy.

*We need to take away these IAS’s comfortable life devoid of any accountability for their country. Take away their big bungalows, their VIP status, their guards, their peons, their orderlies and hook them up to a system where they are rewarded for their good acts and punished for their bad deeds. Unless and until such an overhaul happens, India is not going to be a great country. No welfare policies will ever come to fruition. India cannot change without a change in our bureaucratic system. This is what is wrong with the Indian bureaucracy.*",False,Policy/Economy

The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

This pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

Businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren’t performing. 

Remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

A critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**

Studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, “Out of Adversity comes Opportunity”. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. 

Real Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.

2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.

3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.

5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.

While the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‘Home’ is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India’s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.

· **Real Estate – Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India’s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**

· **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

· **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

· **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

· **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

· **Long Term “Assured” Wealth Building Asset with “Predictable “ Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **“Predictable” Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an “Assured” Capital Appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

· **“Helps you Raise Money Quickly”** \- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!

· **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \- **“Wine and Real Estate improve with Age”** \- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

· **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

· **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

· **Co-living market** size across India’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.

· **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.

· India’s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**

Probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why –**

1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **Low Demand – Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.

4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.

**Final Thoughts:** 

**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**

\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

Simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**The Bottom Line**

**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**

Real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.

**“BUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don’t WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**

What do a planned US$15 billion Saudi investment in petroleum-related Indian businesses and a controversial boxing championship have in common?



Both reflect a world in which power and economics drive policy, politics and business at the expense of fundamental rights.



And both underscore an emerging new world order in which might is right, a jungle in which dissenters, minorities and all other others are increasingly cornered and repressed.



Rather than furthering stability by building inclusive, cohesive societies both support trends likely to produce an evermore unstable and insecure world marked by societal strife, mass migration, radicalization and violence.



A world in which business capitalizes on decisions by a critical mass of world leaders who share autocratic, authoritarian and illiberal principles of governance and often reward each other with lucrative business deals for policies that potentially aggravate rather than reduce conflict.



No doubt, the planned acquisition by Saudi Arabia’s state-owned national oil company Aramco of 20 percent of the petroleum-related businesses of Reliance Industries, one of India’s biggest companies, makes commercial and strategic economic and business sense.



Yet, there is equally little doubt that the announcement of the acquisition will be read by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, days after he scrapped the autonomous status of the troubled, majority Muslim region of Kashmir, as a license to pursue his Hindu nationalist policies that discriminate against Muslims and other minorities and fuel tensions with Pakistan, the subcontinent’s other nuclear power.



The ultimate cost of the fallout of policies and business deals that contribute or give license to exclusion rather than inclusion of all segments of a population and aggravate regional conflict could be far higher than the benefits accrued by the parties to a deal.



Underscoring the risk of exclusionary policies and unilateral moves, cross border skirmishes between Indian and Pakistani forces erupted this week along the Kashmiri frontier in which at least five people were killed.



The timing of the announcement of the Aramco Reliance deal in a global environment in which various forms of racism and prejudice, including Islamophobia, are on the rise, assures Indian political and business leaders that they are unlikely to pay an immediate price for policies that sow discord and risk loss of life.



Like in the case of Saudi and Muslim acquiescence in China’s brutal clampdown on Turkic Muslims in the troubled, north-western Chinese province of Xinjiang, the most frontal assault on a faith in recent history, the announcement risks convincing embattled Muslim minorities like the Uighurs, the Kashmiris or Myanmar’s Rohingya who are lingering in refugee camps in Bangladesh that they are being hung out to dry.



To be sure, Kashmiris can count on the support of Pakistan but that is likely to be little more than emotional, verbal and political.



Pakistan is unlikely to risk blacklisting by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international anti-money laundering and terrorism finance watchdog, at its next scheduled meeting in October by unleashing its anti-Indian militants.



Anthony Joshua’s controversial fight with Andy Ruiz scheduled for December in Saudi Arabia, the first boxing championship to be held in the Middle East, pales in terms of its geopolitical or societal impact compared to the Saudi Indian business deal.



Fact is that Saudi Arabia’s hosting of the championship has provoked the ire of activists rather than significant population groups. The fight is furthermore likely to be seen as evidence and a strengthening of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s selective efforts to socially liberalize the once austere kingdom.



Nonetheless, it also reinforces Prince Mohammed’s justified perception that Saudi Arabia can get away with imprisoning activists who argued in favour of his reforms as well as the lack of transparency on judicial proceedings against the alleged perpetrators of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia insists the killing was perpetrated by rogue operatives.



What Saudi investment in India and the scheduled boxing championship in the kingdom have in common is that both confirm the norms of a world in which ‘humane authority,’ a concept developed by prominent Chinese international relations scholar Yan Xuetong, is a rare quantity.



Mr. Yan employs the concept to argue without referring to President Xi Jinping, Xinjiang, China’s aggressive approach towards the South China Sea or its policy towards Taiwan and Hong Kong that China lacks the humane authority to capitalize on US President Donald J. Trump’s undermining of US leadership.



Mr. Yan defines a state that has humane authority as maintaining strategic credibility and defending the international order by becoming an example through adherence to international norms, rewarding states that live up to those norms and punishing states that violate them. Garnering humane authority enables a state to win allies and build a stable international order.



Mr. Yan’s analysis is as applicable to India and Saudi Arabia as it is to China and others that tend towards civilizational policies like the United States, Russia, Hungary and Turkey.



It is equally true for men like Anthony Joshua promoter Eddie Hearn and business leaders in general.



To be sure, Aramco is state-owned and subject to government policy. Nonetheless, as it prepares for what is likely to be the world’s largest initial public offering, even Aramco has to take factors beyond pure economic and financial criteria into account.



At the end of the day, the consequence of Mr. Yan’s theory is that leadership, whether geopolitical, economic or business, is defined as much by power and opportunity as it is by degrees of morality and ethics.



Failure to embrace some notion of humane authority and reducing leadership and business decisions to exploiting opportunity with disregard for consequences or the environment in which they are taken is likely to ultimately haunt political and business leaders alike.



Said Mr. Yan: “Since the leadership of a humane authority is able to rectify those states that disturb the international order, the order based on its leadership can durably be maintained.”

What is true for political leaders is also true for business leaders even if they refuse to acknowledge that their decisions have as much political as economic impact.

I've invented a stationary utility device and now want to turn it in a business. I've applied for design, patent,trademarks as Intellectual properties. I have completed msme and gst registration. i've prepared visiting cards, proprietor stamp, installed billing software and a 100 pgs letterpad. I have a batch of 400 pcs ready to test the market .  I won't disclose it before the launch so please don't ask about it (no offence).

Not bragging just giving the information, I've done everything alone from research to paperwork to purchase raw material to manufacturing( plastic parts come from factory. i have to assemble it and pack in the box) to finance/money stuff (ca does gst returns). It has really taken a toll on me.

&#x200B;

here's my work environment.

i want to operate from home. my parents are agreed to this and i have access to half of first floor. it's a single room where i do the assembly(tightening screws to join parts) and packing and in one corner i have a table where i do rest of company related work from a laptop.

i'm trying to outsource the packing and assembly but still i'll have to store raw materials and final stock in that room till sent to amazon warehouse or factory.

&#x200B;

i really don't have budget for renting a shop and hiring employee. i want to execute this testing phase alone. if it'll be successfull then i'll get a shop, employees and other equipments but rightnow i don't want to create too much financial burdon on my parents

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

my queries are

1. can i do my business from home . do i need to do any paperwork or permission or licencing. my stock takes space only about a refrigerator.  and all i need a printer and laptop for other stuff.
2. do i need commercial electricity meter. if so, then can my father apply for that (he owns the house and is a GOVT. employee). Is there any way i can avoid that as i'll get my own shop after testing phase and that commercial connection at home will be a waste.

&#x200B;

3.  do i need to pay rent to parents.

&#x200B;

4. can i  cause complications for my father as he's a govt. employee.

&#x200B;

5. do i need any permission from mcd or other anyone.

&#x200B;

6 do i need current account. my expenses are small and i'm currently operating from savings account.  banks (hdfc, icici, bob,axis) are asking for in house verifications and demanding a banner in front of my house. i'll never put a banner in front of house as padosi bade madar\*\*\*\* hain.

570,9ypjsr,"So you made yourself a little bit of money, huh? How nice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9ypjsr/so_you_made_yourself_a_little_bit_of_money_huh/,27,11,DexterMilburn,"# So you made yourself a little bit of money, huh? How nice.
&nbsp;

All your life, all you've ever wanted, is a little bit of money. And congratulations, now you have it. Does it feel nice? Does it feel like a dream come true? Of course it doesn't. It's all just numbers on a screen, staring at you like a pathetic joke. But thanks to your thankless job, you made yourself a little bit of money. How nice.

And now, you, in all your half-decayed intelligence, have decided that you want to invest the little bit of money that you've made? Well, step right up to the raging wildfire that is the field of investing. We've got a shit-show full of stocks, mutual funds, bonds, real estate, gold and other commodities, all clamouring for your attention, and even more for your money. Done properly, you can retire into an ungodly amount of wealth. And done poorly, you can join the majority of investors setting their cash on fire, day in and day out. 

But don't feel daunted or scared. You're on the right path, and that's probably the only time you're going to hear those words in your life. Just the fact that you're thinking about investing your money puts you at a major advantage, just the fact that you've even made a little bit money is extremely rare. Look around you, what do you see? People that are so poor that they're crawling out of their tents on the roadside, people that are such douchebags that they're buying worthless bling like fur sweaters and gold chains, people that are so childish that they absolutely have to buy the latest iPhone with their credit cards, and people that are so dumb that they just can't be bothered to learn about investing. Just the fact that you're here now, thinking about investing, makes you part of an exclusive club.

Before you get ahead of yourself and feel one cent of happiness for being better off than most, let me tell you something - there's an army of twats waiting to screw you out of the little bit of money that you've made, an army of twats who wants to take away the only thing that matters to your miserable existence anymore. These are crooked relationship managers who'll sell you anything to get commissions. These are unsuspecting relatives who'll recommend terrible investments just because they don't know any better. These are seedy stock brokers who'll push schemes offering incredibly high returns that are too good to be true. These are corrupt financial advisors who'll destroy your returns, either because they're incompetent or unscrupulous, or both. You've got an entire armada of twats just waiting to snatch the money right out of your wallet. What're you going to do about that? Are you going to put your head down and hand over the cash? Are you going to run to your mommy like the little bitch that you are? No, you're going to pull out a knife and stab that little twat right in the heart. And here's how to do that, beginning with a set of basic guidelines. 

&nbsp;
##### Savings are sexy
Let's be honest, you were never made of the stuff that gave wet dreams to women. Well, here's your chance. You know what all the girls like these days? It's not that ripped chest, or that sleak jawline. It's a man who saves. Step aside AXE body spray, there's a new sheriff in town. If you're spending more than you're earning, you've got bigger problems to worry. Before anything else, you need to make sure that you're bringing in more money than you're spending. So reign in your spending, delay gratification. That burger is going to taste pretty much the same without the overpriced slice of cheese. And the movie will probably be on Netflix in a few months.

&nbsp;
##### Debt is your kryptonite
So you borrowed a little bit of money and are now stuck with the interest payments. That's okay, who hasn't done dumb stuff when they were young and full of hormones. I know I have. This one time I cleaned up an entire jar of mayonnaise thinking it was yogurt. Set some money aside every month, not just to pay the monthly minimum on your loans, but a little more so you can pre-pay all your debts. Some loans take priority over others: pay off your credit cards, personal loans and similar high-interest debt first. Keep in mind that not all loans are straight poison: those that help you develop assets like a home loan or increase future income like an education loan or business loan are alright. However, investing while carrying a high amount of debt is like playing football with one leg tied behind your back. Not exactly ideal.

&nbsp;
##### Read like your life depends on it
Stop reading WhatsApp forwards, pick up a book, and then pick another one. If you don't develop a habit of reading properly, you're going to get a lot of poop flinged at you in this business. But if you can make it through a book every once in a while, get read to fling some poop on the n00bs. You don't have to go straight for the finance section. Begin with any book that sounds interesting to you, and work your way up. Reading not only helps you understand the world around you, but also develops a better personality and temperament within you. Most of you have the patience and memory of a goldfish, and generally speaking, goldfishes are not good investors.

&nbsp;
##### Gold is old
Gold was what housewives in the 70s stockpiled in their cupboard because they had no other option. But you, you are the child of the 20th century. You actually know how to turn on the wi-fi. You have better options, like mutual funds. No matter what your uncle from the third cousin over says, investing in gold is setting your cash on fire. All it will do is make you feel good from the inside, while the eternal fireplace fuelled by your cash keeps burning in the background. Gold and silver are metals that we dig out of the ground. As an investment, they just sit there and stare at you. Just because they shine doesn't mean they're good investments. However, not everyone is convinced of this basic guideline. So if you're hell bent on investing in gold, I recommend going into the mountains and throwing yourself off a tall cliff. A medium-sized one works too.

&nbsp;
##### Insurance =/= Investing
While housewives in the 70s had gold, housewives in the 80s had LIC*. Getting life insurance is critical if you have family that depends on your income, but insurance and investing, like pizza and pineapple, never mix well. Have you ever wondered what the insurance company does after collecting your premium money? Well, the company invests your premium money in stocks and bonds, which is also what mutual funds do. So let the insurance people insure, and let the investing people invest. Separation of labour was something that the caveman figured out in 2nd century. It's time you evolved from being a caveman.

&nbsp;
##### Real estate is not real investing
The only reason for you to buy property is if you're going to be living in it. Buying real estate purely as an investment is one of the worst decisions you could ever make. Real estate: is an illiquid market (need to wait to find a buyer or seller), has high transaction costs (stamp duty and other bullshit charges), has a lot of red tape (needs several government approvals) and faces high maintenance costs (occasional cost of paint and plumbing here and there). However, every other Tom, Dick and Harry will tell you that real estate is a great investment. Why? Because real estate is how Indians signal wealth to others. It is how Indians demand respect from the *chaar log* committee. It's how we tell people that we've got a big dick, and we're not afraid to swing it around. You don't have a big dick. Tuck that little stinker back in your pants. You're just embarrassing yourself.

&nbsp;
##### Pick your poison properly
Identifying the bad investments is a greater skill than identifying the good investments. Now that gold and real estate have been vilified as bad investments, let's turn to the places that actually deserve your money - mutual funds. For the uninitiated, which includes most of you idiots, a mutual fund collects your money and invests it in the stock market on your behalf. A diversified basket of stocks in good quality companies will outperform most other investments over any time period longer than 10 years. Mutual funds can give you this diversified basket of stocks. If you haven't been living under a rock for the past few years, you've probably see the advertising campaign - *Mutual Funds Sahi Hai*. And if you have been living under a rock, stay there. We're doing great without you.

&nbsp;
##### Get yourself into a coma
The best investors, the ones who win the game in the long-term, always have patience. When you're investing in stocks or mutual funds, you need to have a minimum time horizon of more than 5 years. Any less than that, and out come the fireplaces that are fuelled by your cash. Mentally, you need to be in a place where the stock market might run off a cliff screaming into the wind tomorrow morning, and you'll still continue investing as per your plan because you're thinking about the long term. This ensures that your emotions, influenced by the ups and downs of the stock market, don't get in your own way. Ideally, you want to invest and immediately get yourself into a coma. Trust me, no one will notice that you're gone. You're one person in a world with seven billion people. You're really insignificant in the larger scheme of the Illuminati.

&nbsp;
##### Don't watch CNBC
All your life, you've only made socially acceptable choices, because you crave validation from the people around you. To your repitillian brain, approval from strangers feels better than an orgasm. But when it comes to investing, never seek validation of your choices, especially not from the pundits on CNBC. Televised business news focuses on the shortest of short terms, while you need to keep your eye on the longest of long terms. Yes, it is important to keep tabs on current events, but there are far better sources of information than the nightly news. I recommend reading Livemint and Reuters for news. Those two outfits did not pay me to endorse them, but if the PR people over there are reading this, give me a call. I accept cash, cheques and PayTM. Fuck it, I'll even take bitcoin.

&nbsp;
##### Keep It Simple, Shithead
Here is a basic plan on how to use your money when you get paid every month. First off, take care of any loans by paying off the hungry bankers who will come demanding their pound of flesh. Pay off all credit cards, in full and on time. Now, estimate how much you're going need for your monthly bills - this includes everything from your electric bill to your tab at the local bar. Deduct that amount and invest the rest of your money. When it comes to investing, begin by putting in three months of your monthly expenses in a liquid mutual fund. This is your emergency cash stash. Next up, depending on your time horizon and risk appetite, select a combination of ~3-8 mutual funds. There are a few different types of mutual funds, here's a handy rule of thumb to navigate them:
 
|                                    | High time horizon             | Low time horizon  |
|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| **Low risk appetite**  |Large-cap equity funds      |Debt mutual funds  |
| **High risk appetite** |Mid/small/multi-cap equity funds|Debt mutual funds  |
 
When you're done, set up SIPs so that you don't have to do the transfers manually each month. Every year, take some time off to review this process.

&nbsp;

This basic plan will require tweaking, depending on the context of your life. But having that plan is very important, not just for your financial life but also for the rest of your life. In the back of your mind, you've always known that. But you never followed through on making a plan, and now your life is just a series of mistakes and regrets. Is that why you drink so much? 

The lords of literature require that I write a conclusion to this piece. But this is not the end. This is the beginning of your investing journey. The basic guidelines mentioned here are intended to serve as the starting point for your own research. These guidelines are not rocket science, they are not supposed to be complicated. A person of average intelligence and awareness can reasonably expect to understand and follow them. The question is: are you a person of average intelligence and awareness? Assuming that enough of you read this, statistics require half of you to admit that you're dumb as a rock.

Always keep an eye out for the armada of twats that will try to convince you that investing is rocket science, simply so they can charge you high fees or lure you into unprofitable investments. Done poorly, you can expect a mid-life crisis magnified by a bonfire of your cash. Done properly, you can create the kind of wealth that can benefit you as well as your future generations. You've already disappointed your parents. Don't disappoint your children now.

Even though the exchanges & crypto community in India are seeking remedial action against RBI's diktat, I am not very hopeful that we'll be able to get a stay order from the Supreme Court of India in favour of crypto-currencies. The primary reason for my skepticism being the *little to no understanding of the crypto world that Indian government possesses.* It's noteworthy and depressing at the same time that Finance Minister of India [compared cryptocurrencies to ponzi schemes late last year.](https://qz.com/1171183/bitcoin-is-neither-legal-nor-illegal-in-india-and-everyones-confused/)

This decline in value is sure to repeat at the end of the 3 months window (keeping in mind the **assumption** that RBI's decision holds at the end of these 3 months) with a greater percentage fall this time because investors will not be able to convert their fiat to crypto anymore in India for the immediate future. Personally, I won't be much surprised if XRP value comes down to 0.05$-0.10$ at that time. Without any exception, same shall be the fate of other VCs too.

So, the opportunity lies for those who have accounts with foreign banks since they shall be able to procure cryptocurrencies at dirt cheap prices here in India and be able to sell them abroad at the normal prices prevailing in world markets. This shall be beneficial for both categories of people, those looking to profit out of arbitrage and those intending to HODL them.

The Adani Power Ltd. has claimed that it has paid customs duty on raw ¬materials and consumables – that is, coal imported for the generation of electricity. However, documents leaked to the EPW clearly indicate that the APL had not, in fact, paid the duty on raw materials and consumables amounting to approximately Rs 1,000 crore that had fallen due at the end of March 2015.

Since Modi’s ascension to office, what has happened in the ED, which had registered a preliminary case against Adani in Ahmedabad and was handed details of DRI findings, is illustrative. The officer heading the Ahmedabad branch of the directorate was raided by the CBI, which accused him of possessing disproportionate assets. It failed to prove anything at all, despite months of investigation. The two senior-most officers in the Mumbai regional office, who oversaw the investigations in Ahmedabad, were forced out of the agency. The tenure of Rajan S.

Jagdish Pathak

There are more than one million Indian-origin immigrants in Canada. But compared to rising number of Indian-origin immigrants, Indian investment has not kept pace in Canada. However, slowly but steadily, Indian investments are trickling into the Canadian economy. Economic stability has become key to Canada's success and is decisive in attracting investors from all over the world to its shores. Investment in Canada is considered a safe haven for investors' hard-earned money and continues to represent a solid foundation for future growth and prosperity. 

Canada is the No. 1 investment destination in the G7 and was ranked 4th in the world as the best country to conduct business over the period 2010-14, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's Business Environment Ranking August 2010 report. 

Indian investors have still been shy about investing in Canada. Most investors from India prefer the UK and Europe as well as the countries of the Middle East, historically. Outside this region, Indian investments are scattered and limited. Canada is a stable, secure nation, and endowed with abundant natural resources. Its currency has always been very stable and its safest borders are with the largest economy of the world. Canada/US relations can be described as the best that any two nations can have. 

Canada ranks 27th in terms of FDI investment in India and its investments are mostly in the development sector. Whereas Indian FDI approved until 2009 in Canada is restricted to $570 million and ranks as the 20th destination of Indian investments. 

Recently, in Windsor, I saw a big hoarding on the road showing the name ""Aditya Birla"" on it. I stopped and looked at it with admiration, thinking, at last, Indian investors have made up their mind to make Canada their destination for good. 

Indian investors should consider Canada and especially the province of Ontario to be the hub of their North American business activities. Ontario has liberal laws, a huge existing infrastructure, and various tax benefits to investors, relatively milder climate, fertile farmlands and, without doubt, some of the best golf courses in the world in your neighborhood. 

People here are well aware of Indian investments in the automotive sector of the UK. During the purchasing phase of the Jaguar and Land Rover deal by Tata, India and its investors were commonly discussed in Ontario bars and restaurants. Ontario is the hub of automotive industries and support services for manufacturing automobiles of big-3: US and Japanese car manufacturers like Honda and Toyota. Southwestern Ontario is a key entry point for US and South American markets. 

Canadians are very knowledgeable about India and its information technology-related successes. India is no longer a nation of beggars and snake- charmers in the minds of a younger generation of Canadian citizens. Growth of the Indian software industry has made a big mark on the Canadian psyche. 

Any investment in Canada will have to be planned over the long term similar to US investors in the past. Canadian oil and energy, forestry, mines and minerals, and gold and diamond resources are some of the best resources for investors to look at. The Canadian higher education system is one of the best in the world and at par with the US, resulting in students from across the globe studying and performing high quality research. 

Investors from India are relatively conservative by nature and prefer to satisfy some critical marks before deciding to invest. Canada is one such country which should be the destination of long-term investors from India. One might look at some of the investments made by Indian investors in the Ontario province and think how much is there on offer in this well-endowed province alone. Investments by Essar group in energy and steel, by Mahindra Satyam and Wipro in the IT sector are a good beginning. However, the quantity of investment is negligible, compared to China, which is making substantial investment in the core sectors of oil and energy, solar and wind power generation and forestry. 

A strategic investment in developed nations like Canada goes with the Indian aspiration of becoming a global power. Indian investors can fulfill such desires in conjunction with the geo-political leadership potential of India.

Overnight, the Wall Street suffered its biggest intraday decline in history. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended with a loss of about 1,200 points - nearly 4.6 percent. Shares in other Asian markets were also under strong selling pressure, with Japan's Nikkei down about 5 percent. The Sensex fell as much over 1,200 points to 33,482 while Nifty tumbled below 10,300. The rupee also fell to 64.38 against US dollar, as compared to Monday's close of 64.06.""


* The trigger for the latest global selloff is Friday's job data in US, which showed American wages increasing at the fastest pace since 2009. This has raised alarm about higher inflation and with it potentially higher interest rates.

* In anticipation of the faster-than-expected rate hike from the Federal Reserve - the US central bank, bond yields have spiked in the US, undermining the attraction of equities. Higher bond yields are also seen as negative for emerging markets and commodity prices.

*  Though Finance minister Mr. Arun Jaitley Killed Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency but showed their interest in Blockchain technology, people still likely to [understand all in & Out of Cryptocurrency](https://www.eduonix.com/complete-steemit-course-earn-cryptocurrency-for-free?coupon_code=edu15) as well as interested to purchase it

* On the other hand, [global oil prices have dropped](http://www.bbc.com/news/av/business-30691883/why-are-global-oil-prices-falling) amid recent dollar strength, with international benchmark Brent futures hitting a one-month low of $66.90 per barrel earlier this week. A fall in global oil prices is seen as positive for India as the country imports bulk of its requirement.

* Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday attributed the downslide in the local bourses to selloff in global markets. ""It is not due to the Budget or the LTCG (long-term capital gains tax),"" he said.

* Apart from the global selloff, the domestic sentiment has been hit by the Budget announcement of 10 percent tax on long-term capital gains accrued from equity investments, say, analysts. The Sensex fell over 800 points on Friday and over 300 points on Monday.

* The Street would also be closely watching [Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) policy stance](https://www.ndtv.com/business/rbi-seen-taking-tough-stance-on-inflation-in-monetary-policy-review-1808713) tomorrow.

A news report published in October in The Economic Times said, “Start-ups witness 108% growth in funding in India in 2018.” The news report further mentioned that Artificial Intelligence was among those domains which witnessed the fastest adoption among industry sectors. **Currently, there are about 400 start-ups working on AI and machine learning domains. About $150 million dollars is invested in India’s AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016**. Though there has been growth, India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters, India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens.

There are several start-ups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multi-lingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis

&#x200B;

* **THE ROAD AHEAD**

The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which was put together by the government of India through NITI Aayog sets the roadmap on how to develop AI in the country. The report points out how AI will help the country grow, what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned

 

Capital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE, the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India, recently added AI, IoT, Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come.

Investment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India ($44 million in 2016 to $77 million in 2017). The start-ups have been working towards developing various AI-based products and services. With conglomerates having a lion’s share in India’s market, there is huge scope for AI-based enterprise solutions in the country. The increasing demand for products and services can attract more investment towards R&D in AI sector

Are you tired of simplistic lock and key analogies which pervade most legal and policy discourse surrounding encryption? The last year has seen encryption technologies become a subject of intense discussion in courts and within the government. In India and several other countries, there are demands to weaken encryption through backdoors and key escrow systems to facilitate easier access to information for law enforcement agencies. At the same time, encryption is also one of the few tools available to individuals to protect themselves from surveillance by Big Brother and Big Tech. 

To bring greater clarity and technical rigour to the public discourse surrounding encryption, Internet Freedom Foundation is hosting a lecture on **‘Encryption, Security and Privacy in the Digital Age’** by **Dr. Manoj Prabhakaran** on **Saturday, 23 November 2019** from **6:30 PM to 8:00 PM** at the **Constitution Club, New Delhi**. Dr. Prabhakaran is a Chair Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay and he specialises in cryptography. Through this public lecture, Dr. Prabhakaran will explain the technical aspects of encryption in a comprehensible but nuanced manner and discuss the importance of cybersecurity and online privacy in light of contemporary developments.

We would be delighted if you could join us for the public lecture and [**you can register for the event here**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/encryption-pe-charcha-a-public-lecture-by-dr-manoj-prabhakaran-tickets-81279764965).

592,ctzkd1,[Rant] I'm seriously tired of this is so called education,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ctzkd1/rant_im_seriously_tired_of_this_is_so_called/,14,6,throwaway93681,"This is mostly your weekly education rant, nothing new. Throwaway account since I'd like to stay anonymous and wanted to let my thoughts out in the open.

A bit about me first. I loved computers from a pretty young age but at the time I simply loved it as a hobby. I also remember the young me reading tons of books on topics like space and nature. The only thing I was good at my middle school was Physics and Computer Science but kinda ignored all the other subjects. I also loved helping other students with these subjects to the extent teachers would point out to me with ""stop being so noisy"" and ""get back to your seat"" kind of synonyms. I was pretty open to the future wondering what it held for me. Anyway, I decided to pick up Engineering.

Everything has been going in a downward spiral since then. As any typical kid in India trying to get into a good Engineering college, I went to these so called JEE coaching classes. These places were so horrible. Over time, I realised that these coaching classes are simply forcing down material onto their students. If there was some actual learning happening in there, given the vast syllabus, it wouldn't be so surprising whenever a high school kid from India marked an innovation in science. Rather we see students killing themselves for not being able to score good marks in the examination. There is such an intense pressure on kids since you're constantly being told that not making into a good college equates to no woman marrying you and you're going to be working an awful job, if not jobless. In short, your life is going to become so fucked up that we see kids already making peace with death instead. And then out there are some fucking assholes who feel that this is helping in reducing the population of our country by weeding out the unworthy. Just stop making kids at the rate you shit, fuckheads. Instead of making a positive effect in the country, these coaching centres asking for a shitload of money are simply saturating the already saturated field of Engineering in India. Some parents also force their kids to these coaching centres just because of their faculty flaunting their achievements as if they are a God's gift to this world. Anyway, these coaching centres are just a symptom of the core problem of how most reputed colleges in India accept students solely on the basis of one or two examinations and how colleges like to be seduced into being an AICTE approved college. This whole education thing has turned into fucking business.

I failed my JEE since I couldn't keep up. The failure doesn't hurt me, partially because it is my way of rejecting this system. I've come to a realisation that I cannot learn things solely by books and paper, I need to experience it in reality, or I cannot digest anything. Which is why I was probably good in and loved Physics and Computer Science. It costs virtually nothing to see things in motion and see that the equations really do match up, and write computer programs to do stuff for you and everything makes sense. The thing is that doing everything in such a way consumes a lot of time, but I feel it is worth it. It's extremely hard to work on all the high school concepts here and look out for their real world significance at the same time, all when the examinations are pretty much all formulae and rote based.

Anyway, I joined a tier-3 college hoping to at least make it nice in Computer Science since all you need is a Computer to experience anything. But oh lord fuck this place. Just so you know, I spent my high school years learning to program by writing small scripts to manipulate my environment and eventually, I started working with other people to make open-source software. So all this helped me get into GSoC in my very first year of college and worked with some genuine people working hard to make a positive impact to this world. If not for GSoC, I'd also have been forced to attend the ""summer training"" to ""learn HTML & CSS"" along with other students in the college itself, where the students are kept idle for like half the session and you know what all restrictions they put on even when you are idle - no phones, no YouTube, no heads down for taking a break, no talking to other students (seriously?!). I had another friend of mine who did GSoC in the 2nd year but you know what, students were supposed to ""attend a training institute"" by paying the institute money during this summer break but apparently his GSoC wasn't considered since it was seen as an online course (as opposed to going and attending a training institute) by our Head of Department. So, rejected. Poor guy still had to pay a private institute for his forged training certificate despite of working so hard and lie that he worked on both his training and his GSoC project.

I'll talk about some more wonders here. Our college has so called Soft Skills sessions where instead of learning how to communicate properly with other people, you are simply taught how to flaunt and bluff every little thing to everyone and speak hollow words to ""impress"" other people (since in the end, this college only cares about to headline the highest number of placements offered in the Limca Book of Records). Rather than receiving proper technical knowledge, we spend time practising aptitude questions. Many students here have difficulty communicating, structuring grammar and forming sentences in simple English due to their unfortunate backgrounds and yet no work is ever done to help those students become proficient. It's been 3 semesters since we've been studying about Software Engineering and Software Testing to learn the craft of creating and maintain a software, and literally not a single fucking line of code yet! Most students still believe all that there is to testing a software is looking for bugs by hand. There hasn't even been a mention of automated tests and sort till date and I am 3 years in. And, if the authorities find any students good in solving aptitude questions, they are going to differentiate them by making them solve CodeChef problems in extra classes as if remaining students are merely a possession to the college for the time.

We are assigned to work on a team project every semester and are evaluated by professors who have no experience in the said technology the project is based on. These professors then end up judging students by asking standardised definitions from the desired technology in the final viva instead of actually evaluating by asking project specific questions. No wonder the majority of students steal from GitHub or copy-paste projects from their peers, no one cares. Also, the assignment questions are so blunt with hardly any thinking involved, you can look them up and boom you get full marks if you submitted it on time. Now, I could keep listing whatever the hell is wrong here: Minimum attendance: 75% or no exams for you. Students are forced to stay seated and their heads up even if the concerned subject teacher is on leave and the substitute teacher has nothing to teach about. Internet/WiFi is censored by some company called FortiGuard, anyway the Internet hardly works here. Can't eat, roam or leave the campus before 12 noon. Worst of all, there are students who have been so brainwashed that they blindly trust the authorities just because they believe the faculty is truly full of professionals and are the ones who can help them get a job if they keep repeating their words. We aren't really learning anything here of actual use.

I don't even know whether this is the situation for most colleges in India or I just happen to be in one.

Now here is me who helps with some really nice open-source projects, writes technical posts trying my best not to repeat what the Internet already knows, fighting censorship, trying to help my peers and random internet people with anything technical whenever possible, just because I like to care about people.  All this when college eats up my 9+ hours (including commute) everyday, I really feel like a fucking idiot now. What am I even doing. I don't even want to bother with money or be a rich man, just enough to feed myself or if a family happens someday. This shit has been so sickening lately that I've started doubting that it's just me who the real asshole here is.",False,Science/Technology

I want some career advice but I have no friends in the relevant fields to ask. I graduated in electrical engineering and learnt absolutely nothing and have no skills to get me a job in electrical field. So I turned to IT and worked there for 1 year and god it was shit. I decided I will never get into IT and get into some product based companies. The issue is I have no education in CS. I quit last year and decided to give GATE-2019 in CS/IT paper to make my way into the computer science fields as I feel I am good at coding and stuff. I got AIR of 5300 in the GATE exam and am trying again for next year. (I'll continue with masters in whichever college I get if I don't get a good score this year too).

So now I'm completely clueless as for what my future plans are. Other than attempting GATE and doing masters. What am I supposed to do next? I feel like I don't have any practical skills to make myself employable. I can write programs in C and solve intermediate level coding problems on Hackerrank or similar coding sites. But I doubt that is enough to get me a job. I am thinking of learning some online courses and learn something other than C. But what should I learn? What do I have to learn to make myself employable? I understand that what I should start learning depends on which job I want to get into. But I can't decide and have no one to consult. I hear some buzzwords like data science and machine learning on the news and online but I don't know if that is right for me.

I thought of getting into the following fields: ML, Data science, Web development, Android development.

But again I have not the slightest idea of any of those. As far as I understand, ML and Data science requires more math and I can't say I'm good at math. With web development, I'm afraid it is not like traditional coding and wonder if it has good job opportunities here in India.

If you know any other good field with good opportunities in India please suggest.

TL;DR: I know that I have a goal. Which is to get a good coding related job. But I don't know how to get to that goal. Nor which technology I should get into. So please help me decide.",False,Science/Technology

These are->

1) International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO)

2) International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)

3) International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)

4) International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO)

5) International Astronomy Olympiad (IAO)

6) International Olympiad of Linguistics (IOL)

All of these are extremely prestigious olympiads, which one can not take part in directly. They have various stages in which they sieve out children, and in the end a team of 4-6 children represents a country in these international olympiads. Olympiads organised by silverzone/SOF are misdirecting people into a false sense of prestige, and are making big bucks doing so. They sell admit cards, workbooks, text books, past year papers and whatnot. They even go as far as to copy the names of these olympiads exactly as they are.

Here's an incident: A friend of mine is an IMO bronze medallist, and he shared this fact one day with his relatives. His aunt was quick to respond that her daughter was in fact a gold medal holder in IMO. When he asked which year was the IMO, and where it was held, she told him that the olympiad took place in her daughter's school just a week ago. Here's the kicker, the real IMO has never taken place in India since its inception, and only 11 people in India have won a gold medal.

Just wanted to let out this quick rant. Dont waste your money on these hoax olympiads, and then go on and brag about how your child is a gold medal holder.

A few colleges in India offer admission on the basis of participation in these olympiads, and I was shocked when people from silverzone/SOF olympiads were lining up to claim their seats. Needless to say, they all got rejected, but what was even sadder is that they did not even know about the big 6 olympiads.

If you have been selected into the training camp of any of these 6 olympiads, you can get admission to Chennai Mathematical Institute(one of the best mathematics school in india) and IIIT-H(International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad). You are also selected for an interview at ISI(Indian Statistical Institute) if you have been a member of IMO-TC(training camp for IMO). These are some of the incentives to participate in these olympiads.

But... how?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/at9hy3/digital_colonisation_the_fight_for_indias_soul/,1,4,nibirujiii,"Next to Aadhaar, Facebook may be the greatest modern threat against privacy. How do we fight back and keep Facebook from colonising India?

> ""The business model of the internet is surveillance. We build systems that spy on people in exchange for services. [Corporations call it marketing.](https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2014/04/surveillance_is_the.html)""

Have you noticed? Whenever someone says ""you're being **too political**"", it usually means ""you've mentioned a group of people I don't care about"".

Or **they gaslight you** -- saying you're ""crazy"" for not being white, male, straight, or ""American"" enough. If you dare to notice the discrimination built into their systems, they try to distract from the issue by **attacking you as a person**, trying to force you to jump through endless hoops of arbitrarily defined ""moral purity"".

**This is the typical response on Reddit.** Silicon Valley's social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit) was built by them, for them. ""Them"" means entitled middle-class white males. More specifically: _middle-class, white, aged between 18 and 49, male, cisgender, heterosexual, and mostly American_ males. They built social media for themselves and their friends. The rest of us are unwelcome guests in their safe space.

# **Free Speech versus Diversity?**

This is why the rest of us (non-white, women, LGBT, and others) are treated so badly on their systems. They refuse to ban racist, or violent misogyny and homophobia because it would hurt ""free speech"". Their persecution anxiety leads their bigotry behind slogans like ""diversity is the problem"", ""don't shove _your diversity_ in my face"". George Orwell would be proud (or horrified) to see such twisting of words in service of harmfully bad ideas.

> Here's an analogy: nuclear power can be used to power entire cities and give millions of people energy for centuries, or destroy cities and commit genocide in the blink of an eye. Should we allow the secrets and materials for nuclear to proliferate everywhere, because it's ""just science"" and ""knowledge wants to be free""? Of course not.
> 
> Should we allow bigotry and hatred to rule on social media because it's ""just speech"" and ""information wants to be free""? Of course not.

Now you see the bigotry hidden in Silicon Valley talk about ""free speech"". It's free for them, and the costs are left for us to bear. This is the same as patterns of colonisation throughout the history of Western civilisation. History has begun to repeat itself on the internet.

In other words, they have no grasp of basic morality for anyone who isn't like them. And as you'll see here, that means people in India, Brasil and around the world are now starting to die.

## **Aadhaar's Failure is Facebook's Success**

The question here begins with privacy.

Aadhaar is well-known for allowing unauthorised access to [private information of millions of India's citizens](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/aadhaar-breach-everything-you-need-to-know/story-VhCKHDIL8lziw6OcnhL4wO.html). People are concerned, are rightfully so.

In the case of Facebook, selling your privacy to the highest bidder is the entire profit model. That's why Facebook is ""free"". It's as if Aadhaar's privacy-destroying mistakes are Facebook's business plan.

For India, a country where [69% of citizens live in rural areas](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS), this means that over 300 million people (those who have smartphones) are at risk. And unlike the Indian government's dependence on the will of the people, Facebook is completely unaccountable to anyone but their company shareholders.

# **Facebook's Plan to Colonise India**

Starting in 2014, [Facebook tried to give away free Internet to rural India](https://www.cnet.com/news/why-india-doesnt-want-free-basics). The bargain was simple: if you use internet through Facebook, we give it to you for free. That really means, ""if you allow us to watch, record and sell data about every move you make online, we'll give you access to a limited amount of internet for no cost.""

Thankfully, India's regulators eventually said no, and in 2016, the Free Basics program was stopped.

## **Facebook and Bollywood**

If you've watched any Bollywood films over the past few years, there are two names you'll see and hear all the time. You can probably guess. No, it's not SRK or Deepika Padukone. Also not Salman Khan or Katrina Kaif.

The two names are Facebook and WhatsApp.

Again in rural India, WhatsApp has been involved in [an increasing number of murders](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2017/12/deadly-rumours-india-whatsapp-dilemma-171216091928319.html). The culprit is rumours and intentional misinformation that spread via Facebook's messaging service (WhatsApp).

Even though Facebook's attempts to colonise India are blatant (the Free Basics program) and have led to several deaths (WhatsApp), they are still making more efforts.

Instead of regulators, they are trying to convince citizens that Facebook is good by having celebrities constantly use the service in Bollywood films.

You may not have known this, but Instagram and WhatsApp are owned by Facebook. Now think of how many times you've seen films where the real stars in the background are social media accounts on someone's smartphone. (There's even a Reddit community [specifically for Indian people praising Facebook...!](https://np.reddit.com/r/indianpeoplefacebook/))

# **Democracy, Immigration, Misinformation and Disinformation**

Now think about how easily democracy has been subverted in places like the United States, Britain and Brasil. In the U.S., the Trump campaign openly acknowledged targeting [millions of young women and black voters through Facebook](http://fortune.com/2016/10/30/trump-voter-supression-operations/) to suppress their votes, since they tend to vote Democrat (not Republican; Trump is a Republican). In the case of Brexit, [hundreds of fake Twitter accounts also spread disinformation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/14/how-400-russia-run-fake-accounts-posted-bogus-brexit-tweets).

As more children and adults in mass detainment centres, the American immigration service (ICE) is [using users' private Facebook data to target and hunt down immigrants](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/ice-facebook-data-track-immigrants).

# **To prevent colonisation of our digital lives, we must fight back for our right to privacy.**

So how can we fight against amoral companies like Facebook (with WhatsApp and Instagram) and Twitter?

We now know that [""free"" access via Internet advertising is just another word for intrusive surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/24/deep-surveillance-is-price-of-a-free-web-advertising). We know that in rural India, where many are less educated, people are dying because of misinformation spread through social media. And we know since 2016, that as long as Facebook and Silicon Valley can get away with it, they don't care.

There needs to be an alternative, and it needs to come from the people who are most affected. Not another Facebook, Orkut, Reddit or Twitter, created by white men, for white men -- and if anyone else wants to join, they'd better not be too ""political"". The web is run by narcissists and bullies now, and there has to be a better way.

I'm working with a project that is creating a new social network, but if this post inspires you to start something for India and the rest of the world, I'd be glad to work with you, too. And if you're just hearing some of these facts for the first time, it's okay to be angry. Get angry enough to do something right now. The stakes are too high now to just shrug, turn away and take another selfie: if we let Silicon Valley take our privacy away, they will never give it back.",False,Science/Technology

East Bengal won the game 4-1 with Bhaichung Bhutia scoring a hat-trick. 

I came across this while reading about yesterday's match between India and Bangladesh where the attendance was 61,486. Probably one of the highest in recent times.

> It is to be wondered what would have happened if the AIFF, in a weak moment, reacted to Amal Dutta's suggestion that a foreign referee must be given charge of the match. And if the foreign referee, as Dutta wished, was a strict, unyielding man, the semi-final may not have taken place. For clearly, there were more people in the Salt Lake Stadium than the maximum meant to be accommodated when it was newer and in better condition. Instead of the maximum capacity of 1,20,000, there were 1,31,781. And the precise number mentioned by press reports lends belief that the figures had been given officially.

> Which means that knowingly, the AIFF and the IFA had allowed nearly 12,000 people more for the highly tense semi-final, an unpardonable excess. **The attendance set two records. One for the highest turn-out for any match, not only in India but also anywhere in Asia, and maybe anywhere in the world save for the matches at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.**

- Dhoni doesn't retire post WC, this raises a lot of eyebrows - obviously he is 38, there are better replacements and this is the time to try out new players

- Statement from Rhiti Sports(Dhoni owned and manages him and other CsK) and later on selection panel that Dhoni would not be retiring and rather doing a 2 month stint with the army. Lot of people are surprised by this and don't understand the timing of this post WC.

- In the immediate few days after this,  Audit report of Amrapali group is analysed as part of SC case against the group. Audit trail shows a clear nexus between group and Rhiti Sports, where homebuyers's money has been siphoned off to his wife, Sports Agency and now news even linking the bcci head Shashank Manohar (What??)

- [Side Event] Byjus announced as new jersey sponsor replacing Oppo. No Tender or process for jersey sponsor had been allowed, but just an announcement of Byjus (of all companies) to be jersey sponsor for BCCI. 

## Conclusion

- If you read between the lines, this was a well timed move by Sports Agency or Dhoni to announce the Army stint before the Amrapali Sham comes out to the media. Also most likely the reason for not retiring so can still call a few shots if this goes south (refer to the ipl fixing issue). How far is the bcci involved is anyone's guess with their shady crony practices? 

- Just another thing to bring home the point is none of the other Indian player greats including Sachin, Yuvraj, Sehwag, Clean as hell Dravid, Ganguly have over courted as many controversies as Dhoni. The clout that Dhoni holds is enough for him to walk on to the pitch in IPL even if he was not the fielding team, nor batting and get away with 50% fee fine, that should tell you how muddy our cricket world is (Byjus and all the above).

I was very heartbroken after last Olympics. Been following Indian Olympics sports very closely for last 4 years and I feel this time we can genuinely finish with 10 medals (if we get some luck in our favour). Here are my predictions :-

1) Shooting is very unpredictable sport but this time we have many fearless youngsters who are performing exceptionally well. We should win more than 3 medals at least if all goes well. Our best chances are in events like 10m Air Pistol (both men & women), 10m Air Rifle (both men & women) and Mixed Air Pistol & Mixed Air Rifle team event. You can check performance of our shooting team here https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_ISSF_World_Cup

2) Mirabai Chanu is most certain to win a medal for us at Tokyo. At recently concluded World Championship she finished at fourth place with Chinese occupying top 2 spots. But in weightlifting, a country can only send one athlete in Olympics so that means Mirabai will be 3rd at worst. She is currently 13 kg ahead from her nearest competitor https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Weightlifting_Championships_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_49_kg

3) I think everyone here is aware about Sindhu's badminton exploits. So I won't explain too much. We can also win a surprise medal in men's singles.

4) In Wrestling, Vinesh Phogat & Bajrang Punia is most certain to win a medal for us. We can also win one or two medals from wrestling if we get a favourable draw. Check our wrestling performance from ongoing World Championship https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Wrestling_Championships

5) Amit Panghal is a favourite to win a medal in boxing. He is current Asian Games & Asian Championship gold medalist. He has recently won a silver in World Championship. There were 3 other Indian boxer who were in QF at world championship. I'm slightly unsure about India's chances in women's boxing.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_AIBA_World_Boxing_Championships

Outside of these 5 sports, we have half-chances to win a medal in few other sports like Archery, Hockey, Golf and Tennis. I'm not expecting any medals from athletics. Only Niraj Chopra can finish inside top 5 in athletics event.

This is my own assessment. Please tell me if I'm missing some other medal contenders.",False,Sports

- Gold : 85

I had posted a just few days ago on how investing heavily in only a handful of ""profitable talents"" viz. dance, singing, comedy and cricket; and media's blatant neglect of other talents might discourage talented individuals from pursuing their interests in other fields of sports and art. 

And today I read about these champions of indomitable determination. They proved how, despite their hardships, special abilities and limited support, one can make history. One must also applaud their parents and well wishers for truly believing in their children when the world generally looks down upon people with special needs & abilities.

Most of these sports persons will soon return to their normal lives full of obstacles. I only hope that these men & women of passion get as much support and nurturing as possible from the govt as well as the society. They made India proud. They deserve to be rewarded and rewarded well for bringing glory to the nation. And more importantly for bringing a ray of hope in the lives of millions of others.

[Their homecoming pictures are the best thing I've seen today.](http://www.newindianexpress.com/galleries/sport/2019/mar/24/special-olympics-indias-medal-winners-return-home-amidst-glitzy-and-glory-102173.html)

I went to gate to collect but he did not show up, so I called him and he again said within 2 min he will be there.

Finally he delivered food, When I checked gravy I found quantity was less than usual (50%). Also some gravy was over the package. I immediately felt something is fishy. I suspect that he took away some part of food.

I opened app and checked for help but to my surprise order status was still not showing delivered. I could not report the case.

After waiting for while I cancelled order from my end to get refund and got 100% back.

I was waiting for call from the delivery guy or swiggy but there is no call so far (more than hour now).

I dont think swiggy is at fault here and I am also not 100% sure with my suspicion.

#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

1. Wash your hands frequently
2. Practice respiratory hygiene. Cover mouth and nose with a medical mask, tissue, or flexed elbow when coughing or sneezing. Wash hands afterwards and discard mask or tissue.
3. Maintain social distancing
4. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth
5. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Consult a doctor.
6. As a general precaution, practice general hygiene measures when visiting live animal markets, wet markets or animal product markets
7. Avoid consumption of raw or undercooked animal products
8. If you become sick while travelling, inform crew, seek medical attention early and share travel history.

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

Yesterday I received a video on Whatsapp presenting data about the coronavirus in your country.

The narrator showed interesting statics regarding number of infection and deaths from the new virus. It seems India has a relatively low death rate per million if comparing with other dense populations nations. 

The video attribute these lower rates of death and infection to a homeopathic intervention. 

I have a very scientific mind and it wasn't easy to believe or process this kind of information so I thought it would be wiser to just ask you guys what's happening.

837,fl6f0m,I am in favour of India's current handling strategy of Coronavirus. Hear me out!,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fl6f0m/i_am_in_favour_of_indias_current_handling/,142,96,krav_maga_sensei,"I am sure I am going to be downvoted into oblivion for this. But I want to say this. Please stop panicking. The way India is dealing with the virus with only doing a few tests for only critical cases is a good strategy in my opinion. I am damn sure we are in Phase 3 right now. But hear me out. If India just ramps up testing and hundreds and thousands of cases come to light, then there will be mass hysteria and chaos. India cannot deal with thousands of sick patients at once. Also, around 90% of the cases are mild and it is our elders who are at more risk. If every 20-40-year-old guy flocks to the hospital with just mild symptoms and wants to get treated, that means the elderly will have fewer chances to get treated.

Instead, just isolate yourself at home and not infect everyone around you. If the symptoms get worse after a week, then you can visit the hospital or call the helpline. Most of the cases are mild and because of the panic created by everyone, many people think they are gonna die the moment they get infected. You are more likely not to die. So just with mild symptoms, it does not make any sense to just flock the hospitals. There are many other critically ill patients who need treatment before all us healthy young folks.

Imagine going to the hospital with your 60-65-year-old dad who has symptoms and finding the hospital is full of young adults with mild symptoms which will most likely go away if they get self-isolated rather than spreading it around walking everywhere.

India cannot afford such chaos. All we can do is only do a few tests for most vulnerable people and let the health care catch up with the number of critically ill cases and let all the mild cases of younger people self isolate. I really think this is the best strategy for a country like India. If we just ramp up tests and find thousands of cases at once, I think we will have people dying of other issues in the chaos than Coronavirus.",False,Coronavirus

The numbers dont seem to be decreasing. Nor they are increasing dramatically.   
Both facts somewhat concern me, they should be decreasing right? we enforced lockdown to decrease spread. And we are planning on opening lockdowns when the numbers have not even started their downward trend!   
Also why the numbers are not increasing!? Is it because we are doing really less testing and the numbers that should be caught are not being caught. If we have the capacity to do more testing we would end up catching more people with the virus?  


Given our lockdown is not the most strictly enforced lockdown, the spread will keep happening. Argh, sometimes the situation seems quite hopeless! :/
